        of involved users, web services and community organizers?}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Most of the work on communities of
            services are either user-centric and focus on user satisfaction
            or system-centric and focus on the whole system throughput, performance and utilization.
        \end{itemize}


    \item \textbf{How can we model fair and stable communities as coalitions
        of agent-based web services?}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item All parties involved are self-interest agents and have the right to leave the community if they can improve their income in some other ways.

%         \item Cooperative games are a branch of game theory that models cooperation or collaboration between agents.
%         \begin{itemize}
%            \item Cooperation to perform a set of tasks that requires different expertise.
%            \item Agents do not have enough resource on their own to perform the tasks.
%            \item Examples:
%            \begin{itemize}
%                \item Robots have the ability to move objects in a plant, but multiple robots are required to move a heavy box.
%                \item Transportation domain: agents are trucks, trains, airplanes, ships... a task is a good to be transported.
%            \end{itemize}
%        \end{itemize}
%        \item \textbf{Issues:}
%            \begin{itemize}
%                \item Coalition formation.
%                \item Rewarding members when a task is completed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Cooperative Game Theory}
    \begin{itemize}
         \item Cooperative games are a branch of game theory that models cooperation or collaboration between agents within coalitions.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{definition} [Coalition]~\\
       We have a population $N$ of $n$ agents, A coalition $C$ is a set of agents: $C \in 2^N$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $N$ is the set of all agents (or players)
            \item $v:2^N \rightarrow R$ is the \emph{valuation function}. For $C \subseteq N$, $v(C)$ is the value obtained by the coalition $C$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{definition}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Problem:} Given a game $(N,v)$, and assuming all agents in $N$ want to cooperate, how to distribute the gain among the agents?
        \item \textbf{Solution:} a payoff distribution $x \in R^n$ that provides a value to individual agents.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item What are the interesting properties that $x$ should satisfy?
            \item How to determine the payoff vector $x$?
        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\begin{frame}{Transferable and Non Transferable Utility Games}
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item \textbf{Games with Transferable Utility (TU games)}
%        \begin{itemize}
%            \item Utility is worth the same for all agents.
%            \item Utility can be {\color{red} compared} or {\color{red} transferred} between agents.
%            \item Irrespective of the division of the coalitional payoff.
%            \begin{itemize}
%                \item In that case members of the coalition enjoy the same total utility.
%            \end{itemize}
%        \end{itemize}
%
%
%        \begin{definition} [Valuation or Characteristic Function]\label{dfn:valuationfunction}
%            A \emph{valuation function v} associates a real number $v(C)$ to any subset $C \subseteq N$, i.e., $v:2^N \rightarrow R$ \\
%            A {\color{blue}\emph{TU game}} is a pair $(N,v)$ where $N$ is a set of agents and where $v$ is a valuation function.
%        \end{definition}
%
%
%
%        \item \textbf{Games with Non Transferable Utility (NTU games)} \\
%            Agents have different preferences over coalitions and rewards. Non-monetary rewards, i.e. item allocation type of problems where items have %different values for different players.
%    \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\begin{frame}{Some Properties of Valuation Functions}
%    $\forall C_1,C_2 \subseteq N | C_1 \bigcap C_2 = \emptyset, i \in N, i \notin C_1$
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item {\color{blue} Additive:} $v(C_1 \bigcup C_2) = v(C_1) + v(C_2)$
%        \item {\color{blue} Super additive:} $v(C_1 \bigcup C_2) \geq v(C_1) + v(C_2)$ This is satisfied is many applications, or bigger coalitions will not form.
%        \item {\color{blue} Weekly super additive:} $v(C_1 \bigcup \{i\}) \geq v(C_1) + v(\{i\})$
%        \item {\color{red} Subadditive:} $v(C_1 \bigcup C_2) \leq v(C_1) + v(C_2)$
%    \end{itemize}
%
%    $\forall C_1,C_2 \subseteq N$
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item {\color{blue} Convex:} $v(C_1 \bigcup C_2) \geq v(C_1) + v(C_2) - v(C_1 \bigcap C_2)$. Convexity has important properties in cooperative game theory solution concepts.

%\begin{frame}{Solution Properties}
%    Let $x \in R^n$ be a solution of the coalition game $(N,v)$
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item {\color{blue} Feasible solution:} $\sum_{i \in N} x(i) \leq v(N)$
%        \item {\color{blue} Efficiency:} $\sum_{i \in N} x(i) = v(N)$
%        \begin{itemize}
%            \item the payoff distribution is an allocation of the entire worth of the grand coalition to all agents.
%        \end{itemize}
%        \item {\color{blue} Individual rationality:} $\forall i \in N, x(i) \geq v(\{i\})$
%        \begin{itemize}
%            \item player obtains at least its self-value of payoff.
%        \end{itemize}
%        \item {\color{blue} Group rationality:} $\forall C \subseteq N, \sum_{i \in N} x(i) \geq v(C)$
%    \end{itemize}
%
%    \vspace{0.2cm}
%
%    An {\color{blue} imputation} is a payoff distribution $x$ that is efficient and individual rational.
%
%\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\begin{frame}{Stability}
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item We all want to work together and get $v(N)$, but we all have different views about how to share the fruits of our work. We can use the values of other coalitions as arguments in favor of a distribution.
%        \item A condition for a coalition to form:
%            {\color{blue}all} agents prefer to be in it. i.e., none of the participants wishes she were in a different coalition or by herself {\color{blue} $\Rightarrow Stability$ }
%        \item The {\color{blue} core} is a stability concept for which no agents prefer to deviate to form a different coalition.
%    \end{itemize}
%\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame} {Solution Concepts: Core}
    The core relates to the stability of the grand coalition: \\ No group of agents has any incentive to change coalition.
    \begin{definition}[$Core$ of a Game $(N,v)$]\label{dfn:core}
        Let $(N,v)$ be a cooperative game, and assume they form the coalition $N$. The core of $(N,v)$ is the set:
        \vspace{0.1cm}
        \begin{center}
            $Core(N,v) = \{x \in R^n | x$ is a group rational imputation$\}$
        \end{center}
        Equivalently,
        \vspace{0.1cm}
        \begin{center}
            $Core(N,v) = \{x \in R^n | x(N) \leq v(N) \wedge x(C) \geq v(C), \forall C \subseteq N\}$ \\
        \end{center}
        \small{$x(N) = \sum_{i \in N} x(i)$}
    \end{definition}

    \begin{itemize}
       \item The coalition is stable $\Leftrightarrow$ The core is not empty
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\begin{frame} {Example: Core}
%
%    \begin{center}
%      $N = \{1,2\}$ \\
%      $v(\{1\}) = 5, v(\{2\}) = 5$ \\
%      $v(\{1,2\}) = 20$ \\
%    \end{center}
%
%    $Core(N,n) = \{(x_1,x_2) \in R^2 | x_1 \geq 5, x_2 \geq 5, x_1 + x_2 = 20\}$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Solution Concepts: Shapley Value}
    \begin{definition} [Marginal Contribution]\label{dfn:marginalcontribution}
        The {\color{blue}marginal contribution} of agent $i$ for a coalition $C \subseteq N \backslash \{i\}$ is $mc_i(C) = v(C \cup \{i\}) - v(C)$
    \end{definition}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item By considering average marginal contribution over all possible subsets of coalitions, we can achieve a fair distribution.\\
        \item Let $\prod(N)$ denote the set of all permutations of the sequence $(1,...n)$. Therefore: $\phi_i(N,v) = \frac{\sum_{\sigma \in \phi_i(N)}}{mc(\sigma)}$
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{definition} [Shapley Value]\label{dfn:shapleyvalue}
        Given a coalitional game $(N,v)$, the Shapley value of player $i$ is given by: \\
        $\phi_i(N,v) = \sum_{S \subseteq N \backslash \left\{i\right\} } \frac{|S|! (|N|-|S|-1)!}{|N|!} (v(S \cup \left\{i\right\}) - v(S))$
    \end{definition}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Some Properties}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The core may not always be non-empty.
        \item Shapley value always exists and is unique.
        \item When the valuation function is {\color{blue}superadditive}, the Shapley value is {\color{blue}individually rational}, i.e., it is an imputation.
        \item When the valuation function is {\color{blue}convex}, the Shapley value is also group rational, hence, it is in the {\color{blue}core}.
        \item A convex game has a non-empty core.
        \item Core and Shapley value are combinatorial problems.

\begin{frame}{Problem Formulation and Modeling}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Communities of web services are robust service providers with well established market share and reputation.
        \item The community is characterized by a request rate $R_C$.
        \item Web services can perform tasks with some throughput rate ($Th_{ws}$).
        \item Web services come with different values of $QoS_{ws}$ for different metrics.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Task Distribution}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Our model uses a slightly modified \emph{weighted fair queuing} method for task distribution rather than Contract-Net.
        \item All the input flow is multiplexed among different web services with weights proportional to their throughput value ($Th_{ws}$).
        \item Queues will happen if $R_C$ is more than the summation of web services throughput.
        \item Weighted task rate: $R_C \times \frac{Th_{ws}}{\sum_{ws}{Th_{ws}}}$ or $Th_{ws}$

        \item In case of web service failure, a portion of tasks will not be handled efficiently until replacement is found.
        \item By imposing cost on deviation or subsiding the community, its possible to attract more web services and keep the community stable.
        \item Will be cost efficient in case of web service failure, or for replacing web services dropping in QoS metrics as they advertised.

%\begin{frame}{Induced Subgraph Games}
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item An induced subgraph game is a coalitional game defined by an undirected weighted graph $G = (V,W)$ where $V$ is the set of vertices and $W : V \rightarrow V$ is the set of edges weights. For $(i,j) \in V^2$, $w_{ij}$ is the weight of the edge between $i$ and $j$.
%        \item $N = V$
%        \item for all $C \subseteq N, v(C) = \sum_{(i,j) \in C} w_{ij}$
%        \item {\color{blue}Space Complexity:} Using an adjacency matrix, we need to provide $n^2$ entries.
%        \item {\color{blue}Convexity:} If all the weights are nonnegative then the game is convex.
%        \item {\color{blue}Shapley Value:} $\phi_i(N,v) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{(i,j) \in N^2 | i \neq j}w_{ij}$
%        \item This is {\color{blue}not complete}. Many coalition games cannot be represented by a induced subgraph game.
