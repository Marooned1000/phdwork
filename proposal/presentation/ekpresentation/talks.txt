Thanks everyone for attending. I'm going to present my proposal which is about Cooperative decision making mechanisms for community of autonomous web services in multiagent setting. 

I'm going to start with a brief introduction on my research subject and plan, then I'll talk about the background and literature review, then the proposed research and finally the time line.
