    \item \textbf{How can we model the
        community of agent-based services in order to maximize the utility
        of involved users, web services and community organizers?}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Most of the recent work on communities of
            services are either user-centric and focus on user satisfaction
            or system-centric and focus on the whole system throughput, performance and utilization.
        \end{itemize}


    \item \textbf{How can we model fair and stable communities as coalitions
        of agent-based web services?}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item All parties involved are self-interest agents and have the authority to deviate leave the community if they can improve their income in some other ways.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% frame14 Background and Literature Review %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{The Classic Problem}
    We have a population $N$ of $n$ agents.
    \begin{definition} [Coalition]~\\
       A coalition $C$ is a set of agents: $C \in 2^N$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $N$ is the set of all agents (or players)
            \item $v:2^N \rightarrow R$ is the \emph{valuation function}. For $C \subseteq N$, $v(C)$ is the value obtained by the coalition $C$
        \end{itemize}
        \label {dfn:Coalition}
    \end{definition}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{problem:} a game $(N,v)$, and we assume all agents in $N$ want to cooperate.
        \item \textbf{solution:} a payoff distribution $x \in R^n$ that provides a value to individual agents.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item What are the interesting properties that $x$ should satisfy?
            \item How to determine the payoff vector $x$?
        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{An Example}

    \begin{center}
        $N = \{1,2,3\}$ \\
        $v(\{1\}) = 0, v(\{2\}) = 0, v(\{3\}) = 0$ \\
        $v(\{1,2\}) = 90$ \\
        $v(\{1,3\}) = 80$ \\
        $v(\{2,3\}) = 70$ \\
        $v(\{1,2,3\}) = 105$ \\
    \end{center}

    What should we do?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item form $\{1,2,3\}$ and share equally $(35,35,35)$?
        \item 3 can say to 1 ``let's form $\{1,3\}$ and share (40,0,40)''
        \item 2 can say to 1 ``let's form $\{1,2\}$ and share (45,45,0)''
        \item 3 can say to 2 ``OK, let's form $\{2,3\}$ and share (0,46,24)''
        \item 1 can say to 2 and 3, ``fine! $\{1,2,3\}$ and (33,47,25)''
        \item ...what is a good solution?

\begin{frame}{Transferable and Non Transferable Utility Games}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Games with Transferable Utility (TU games)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Utility is worth the same for all agents
            \item Utility can be {\color{red} compared} or {\color{red} transfered} between agents.
            \item Irrespective of the division of the coalitional payoff, members of the coalition enjoy the same total utility.
        \end{itemize}


        \begin{definition} [Valuation or Characteristic function]\label{dfn:valuationfunction}
            A \emph{valuation function v} associates a real number $v(C)$ to any subset $C \subseteq N$, i.e., $v:2^N \rightarrow R$ \\
            A {\color{blue}\emph{TU game}} is a pair $(N,v)$ where $N$ is a set of agents and where $v$ is a valuation function.
            \label {dfn:valuationfunction}
        \end{definition}



        \item \textbf{Games with Non Transferable Utility (NTU games)} \\
            Agents have different preferences over coalitions and rewards. Non-monetary rewards, i.e. item allocation type of problems where items have different values for different players.
    \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Some properties of valuation functions}
    $\forall C_1,C_2 \subseteq N | C_1 \bigcap C_2 = \emptyset, i \in N, i \notin C_1$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\color{red} additive:} $v(C_1 \bigcup C_2) = v(C_1) + v(C_2)$
        \item {\color{red} super additive:} $v(C_1 \bigcup C_2) \geq v(C_1) + v(C_2)$ This is satisfied is many applications, or bigger coalitions will not form.
        \item {\color{red} weekly super additive:} $v(C_1 \bigcup \{i\}) \geq v(C_1) + v(\{i\})$
        \item {\color{red} subadditive:} $v(C_1 \bigcup C_2) \leq v(C_1) + v(C_2)$
    \end{itemize}

    $\forall C_1,C_2 \subseteq N$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\color{red} convex:} $v(C_1) + v(C_2) \leq v(C_1 \bigcup C_2) + v(C_1 \bigcap C_2)$ Convexity has important properties in cooperative game theory solution concepts.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Solution properties}
    Let $x \in R^n$ be a solution of the TU game $(N,v)$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\color{red} Feasible solution:} $\sum_{i \in N} x(i) \leq v(N)$
        \item {\color{red} Efficiency:} $x(N) = v(N)$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item the payoff distribution is an allocation of the entire worth of the grand coalition to all agents
        \end{itemize}
        \item {\color{red} Individual rationality:} $\forall i \in N, x(i) \geq v(\{i\})$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item player obtains at least its self-value of payoff
        \end{itemize}
        \item {\color{red} Group rationality:} $\forall C \subseteq N, \sum_{i \in N} x(i) \geq v(C)$
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{0.2cm}

    An {\color{red} imputation} is a payoff distribution $x$ that is efficient and individual rational.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Stability}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We all want to work together and get $v(N)$, but we all have different views about how to share the fruits of our work. We can use the values of other coalitions as arguments in favor of a distribution.
        \item 3 can say to 1 ``let's form $\{1,3\}$ and share (40,0,40)''
        \item 2 can say to 1 ``let's form $\{1,2\}$ and share (45,45,0)''
        \item 3 can say to 2 ``OK, let's form $\{2,3\}$ and share (0,46,24)''

\begin{frame}{Computation Tree Logic of Commitment (CTLC)}
CTLC logic is an extension of CTL logic with modalities for reasoning about \textbf{commitments and their fulfillment}.
\begin{definition} [Model of CTLC]\label{Model of CTLC}
A model $\mathcal{M_C}=(S,I,R_t, \{\sim _{i \rightarrow j}|{(i,j)\in \mathcal{A}^2}\},\mathcal{V})$ that belongs to the set of all models $\mathbb{M}$ is a tuple, where:
\begin {itemize}
\item $S, I, R_t$ and $\mathcal{V}$ are the same as in Definition (Model of CTLK).
\item For each pair $(i, j) \in \mathcal{A}^2 $, $\sim _{i \rightarrow j} \subseteq S \times S $ is the social accessibility relation defined by $ s \sim _{i \rightarrow j} s' $ iff
     1) $ l_i(s) = l_i(s') $ and 2) $ Var_i \cap Var_j \neq \emptyset $ such that  $ \forall x \in Var_i \cap Var_j $ we have $ l_i^x(s) = l_j^x(s') $ and $ \forall y \in Var_j - Var_i $ we have $ l_j^y(s) = l_j^y(s')$.

\end {itemize}
\label {dfn: Model of CTLC}

\varphi \mid EX \varphi  \mid E ( \varphi U \varphi) \mid EG
\varphi \mid C_{i\rightarrow j} \varphi \mid Fu (C_{i\rightarrow
j}\varphi)$.
\label {dfn: Syntax of CTLC}\\
Where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $ p, E, X, G, U, \neg $ and $\vee$ are defined as in Definition (Syntax of CTLK);
  \item The modal connective $C_{i \rightarrow j}$ stands for ``commitment from $i$ to $j$"; and
  \item The modal connective $Fu$ stands for ``fulfillment".
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\textbf{In this logic, $C_{i\rightarrow j}\varphi$ is read as ``agent $i$ commits towards agent $j$ to bring about $\varphi$". $Fu (C_{i\rightarrow j}\varphi)$ is read as ``the commitment $C_{i\rightarrow j}\varphi$ is fulfilled".}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame} {Satisfaction of CTLC}
As the main fragment of CTLC logic is the CTL logic, hereafter, we only recall the semantics of the commitment and fulfillment modalities.
\begin{itemize}
\item $ (\mathcal{M_C}, s ) \models C_{i\rightarrow j} \varphi $ iff for all global states $ s' \in S $ such that $ s \sim_{i \rightarrow j} s' $, we have $ (\mathcal{M_C}, s' ) \models \varphi $;
\item $ (\mathcal{M_C}, s ) \models Fu (C_{i\rightarrow j} \varphi)$ iff there exists $ s' \in S $ such that $ s' \sim_{i \rightarrow j} s $ and $ (\mathcal{M_C}, s' ) \models C_{i\rightarrow j} \varphi$.

$L_1 \otimes L_2$ is the smallest logic with the following
characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The language $\mathcal{L}_{L_1\otimes L_2}$ is the union of $\mathcal{L}_{L_1}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{L_2}$.
  \item The logic $L_1 \otimes L_2$ is axiomatised by the set of axioms $\mathcal{X}_1 \cup \mathcal{X}_2$.
\end{itemize}

$F_1 = (S, R_1^1, \dots, R_n^1)$ and $F_2 = (S, R_1^2, \dots
,R_m^2 )$ where $R^1_{x/x\in[1,n]}$ and $R^2_{y/y\in[1,m]}$ are
\textbf{accessibility relations}, then the semantics for $L_1 \otimes L_2$
can be defined in the Kripke frame $F =(S, R_1^1, \dots , R_n^1,
R_1^2, \dots ,R_m^2 )$ obtained by the \textit{independent join} of the two

\subsection{Desiderata of Paradoxes}

\begin{frame}{Desiderata of Paradoxes}
Paradoxes are represented as reasoning rules that are: 1) not reasonable in
open MAS, but they are valid in CTLKC; or 2) desirable for the
interaction between knowledge and commitments, but they can get
violated in CTLKC because they are not valid.
 \begin{enumerate}

\vspace{0.2cm} \item [P1.]\textbf{[Committing everything known to
others]}

$K_i \varphi \Rightarrow C_{i \rightarrow j}\varphi, $ for all $j
\in A$ where $i \neq j$.

\textbf{ Meaning:} An agent (the debtor) commits towards all other
agents (the creditors) about what he knows.\\
\textbf{Example 1:}
$K_{Mer}$ $deliverGoods \Rightarrow$ $C_{Mer \rightarrow
Cus}$ $deliverGoods$.

\vspace{0.2cm} \item [P2.]\textbf{[Committing everything known by
others]}

 $ K_i K_j \varphi \Rightarrow C_{i \rightarrow j} \varphi$ such that $ i \neq j$.

\textbf{Meaning:} An agent (the debtor) commits toward another
agent (the creditor) to bring about what he (i.e., the debtor)

In addition to the properties of knowledge (in CTLK) and commitments (in CTLC), those properties hold in CTLKC:
\begin{enumerate}

\vspace{0.2cm} \item [Prop 1.] $C_{i \rightarrow j}\varphi
\Rightarrow \varphi$ is satisfiable but not valid.
\vspace{0.2cm} \item [Prop 2.] $C_{i \rightarrow j}\varphi

\vspace{0.2cm} \item [Prop 3.] $(C_{i \rightarrow j}\varphi \wedge
K_i (\varphi \Rightarrow \psi)) \Rightarrow C_{i \rightarrow j}
\psi$ is valid.
\vspace{0.2cm} \item [Prop 4.] $(C_{i \rightarrow j}(\varphi

    \begin{frame}{Contributions}

    \begin{itemize}
     \itemsep=.35cm
     \item A new combined temporal logic, called CTLKC, that combines both CTLK and CTLC logics is introduced.
     \item This logic served as a language to express a set of rules that are used to reason about the interaction between knowledge and social commitments.
     \item Selection criteria are proposed to capture such reasoning rules.
     \item Nine paradoxes are recognized in CTLKC logic that should be addressed in any consistent logic combining knowledge and commitments.
     \item Six properties are identified and should be met in any logic combining knowledge and commitments.

\subsection{Research Activities Goal}
    \begin{frame}{Research Activities Goal}
    We aim to cover all possible relations between knowledge and commitments as single and group interactions by:

        \begin{itemize}
              \item Defining a new consistent logic that combines knowledge and commitments and solves the nine paradoxes while satisfying the six properties.
              \item Addressing the model checking problem of the new logic from both algorithmic and complexity perspectives.
              \item Implementing the new model checking algorithms on top of MCMAS+.
              \item Identifying a new semantics for group committing.
              \item Adding the group knowledge to the framework.
