        of involved users, web services and community organizers?}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Most of the recent work on communities of
            services are either user-centric and focus on user satisfaction
            or system-centric and focus on the whole system throughput, performance and utilization.
        \end{itemize}


    \item \textbf{How can we model fair and stable communities as coalitions
        of agent-based web services?}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item All parties involved are self-interest agents and have the authority to deviate leave the community if they can improve their income in some other ways.

         \item Cooperative games are a branch of game theory that models cooperation or collaboration between agents.
         \begin{itemize}
            \item A set of tasks needs to be performed, they require different expertise.
            \item Agents do not have enough resource on their own to perform a task.
            \item Find complementary agents to perform the tasks.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item robots have the ability to move objects in a plant, but multiple robots are required to move a heavy box.
                \item transportation domain: agents are trucks, trains, airplanes, ships... a task is a good to be transported.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{issues:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item What coalition to form?
                \item How to reward each each member when a task is completed?
            \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% frame14 Background and Literature Review %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{The Classic Problem}
    We have a population $N$ of $n$ agents.
    \begin{definition} [Coalition]~\\
       A coalition $C$ is a set of agents: $C \in 2^N$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $N$ is the set of all agents (or players)
            \item $v:2^N \rightarrow R$ is the \emph{valuation function}. For $C \subseteq N$, $v(C)$ is the value obtained by the coalition $C$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{definition}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{problem:} a game $(N,v)$, and we assume all agents in $N$ want to cooperate.
        \item \textbf{solution:} a payoff distribution $x \in R^n$ that provides a value to individual agents.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item What are the interesting properties that $x$ should satisfy?
            \item How to determine the payoff vector $x$?
        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{An Example}

    \begin{center}
        $N = \{1,2,3\}$ \\
        $v(\{1\}) = 0, v(\{2\}) = 0, v(\{3\}) = 0$ \\
        $v(\{1,2\}) = 90$ \\
        $v(\{1,3\}) = 80$ \\
        $v(\{2,3\}) = 70$ \\
        $v(\{1,2,3\}) = 105$ \\
    \end{center}

    What should we do?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item form $\{1,2,3\}$ and share equally $(35,35,35)$?
        \item 3 can say to 1 ``let's form $\{1,3\}$ and share (40,0,40)''
        \item 2 can say to 1 ``let's form $\{1,2\}$ and share (45,45,0)''
        \item 3 can say to 2 ``OK, let's form $\{2,3\}$ and share (0,46,24)''
        \item 1 can say to 2 and 3, ``fine! $\{1,2,3\}$ and (33,47,25)''
        \item ...what is a good solution?
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Transferable and Non Transferable Utility Games}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Games with Transferable Utility (TU games)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Utility is worth the same for all agents
            \item Utility can be {\color{red} compared} or {\color{red} transfered} between agents.
            \item Irrespective of the division of the coalitional payoff, members of the coalition enjoy the same total utility.
        \end{itemize}


        \begin{definition} [Valuation or Characteristic function]\label{dfn:valuationfunction}
            A \emph{valuation function v} associates a real number $v(C)$ to any subset $C \subseteq N$, i.e., $v:2^N \rightarrow R$ \\
            A {\color{blue}\emph{TU game}} is a pair $(N,v)$ where $N$ is a set of agents and where $v$ is a valuation function.
        \end{definition}



        \item \textbf{Games with Non Transferable Utility (NTU games)} \\
            Agents have different preferences over coalitions and rewards. Non-monetary rewards, i.e. item allocation type of problems where items have different values for different players.
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Some properties of valuation functions}
    $\forall C_1,C_2 \subseteq N | C_1 \bigcap C_2 = \emptyset, i \in N, i \notin C_1$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\color{red} additive:} $v(C_1 \bigcup C_2) = v(C_1) + v(C_2)$
        \item {\color{red} super additive:} $v(C_1 \bigcup C_2) \geq v(C_1) + v(C_2)$ This is satisfied is many applications, or bigger coalitions will not form.
        \item {\color{red} weekly super additive:} $v(C_1 \bigcup \{i\}) \geq v(C_1) + v(\{i\})$
        \item {\color{red} subadditive:} $v(C_1 \bigcup C_2) \leq v(C_1) + v(C_2)$
    \end{itemize}

    $\forall C_1,C_2 \subseteq N$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\color{red} convex:} $v(C_1 \bigcup C_2) \geq v(C_1) + v(C_2) - v(C_1 \bigcap C_2)$. Convexity has important properties in cooperative game theory solution concepts.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Solution properties}
    Let $x \in R^n$ be a solution of the TU game $(N,v)$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\color{red} Feasible solution:} $\sum_{i \in N} x(i) \leq v(N)$
        \item {\color{red} Efficiency:} $x(N) = v(N)$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item the payoff distribution is an allocation of the entire worth of the grand coalition to all agents
        \end{itemize}
        \item {\color{red} Individual rationality:} $\forall i \in N, x(i) \geq v(\{i\})$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item player obtains at least its self-value of payoff
        \end{itemize}
        \item {\color{red} Group rationality:} $\forall C \subseteq N, \sum_{i \in N} x(i) \geq v(C)$
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{0.2cm}

    An {\color{red} imputation} is a payoff distribution $x$ that is efficient and individual rational.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Stability}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We all want to work together and get $v(N)$, but we all have different views about how to share the fruits of our work. We can use the values of other coalitions as arguments in favor of a distribution.
        \item A condition for a coalition to form:
            {\color{red}all} agents prefer to be in it. i.e., none of the participants wishes she were in a different coalition or by herself {\color{red} $\Rightarrow Stability$ }
        \item The {\color{red} core} is a stability concepts for which no agents prefer to deviate to form a different coalition.
        \item Is the coalition stable $\Leftrightarrow$ Is the core non-empty
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame} {Solution Concepts: Core}
    The core relates to the stability of the grand coalition: \\ No group of agents has any incentive to change coalition.
    \begin{definition}[$Core$ of a game $(N,v)$]\label{dfn:core}
        Let $(N,v)$ be a cooperative game, and assume they form the coalition $N$. The core of $(N,v)$ is the set:
        \vspace{0.1cm}
        \begin{center}
            $Core(N,v) = \{x \in R^n | x$ is a group rational imputation$\}$
        \end{center}
        Equivalently,
        \vspace{0.1cm}
        \begin{center}
            $Core(N,v) = \{x \in R^n | x(N) \leq v(N) \wedge x(C) \geq v(C) \forall C \subseteq N\}$
        \end{center}
    \end{definition}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame} {Example: Core}

    \begin{center}
      $N = \{1,2\}$ \\
      $v(\{1\}) = 5, v(\{2\}) = 5$ \\
      $v(\{1,2\}) = 20$ \\
    \end{center}

    $Core(N,n) = \{(x_1,x_2) \in R^2 | x_1 \geq 5, x_2 \geq 5, x_1 + x_2 = 20\}$

        %\caption{The NetBill payment protocol} \label{figure7}
    \end{figure}

    The core may not be fair: the core only considers stability.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Solution Concepts: Shapley Value}
    \begin{definition} [Marginal contribution]\label{dfn:marginalcontribution}
        The {\color{red}marginal contribution} of agent $i$ for a coalition $C \subseteq N \backslash \{i\}$ is $mc_i(C) = v(C \cup \{i\}) - v(C)$
    \end{definition}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item By considering average marginal contribution over all possible subset of coalitions, we can achieve a fair distribution.\\
        \item Let $\prod(N)$ denote the set of all permutations of the sequence $(1,...n)$. Therefore: $\phi_i(N,v) = \frac{\sum_{\sigma \in \phi_i(N)}}{mc(\sigma)}$
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{definition} [Shapley Value]\label{dfn:shapleyvalue}
        Given a coalitional game $(N,v)$, the Shapley value of player $i$ is given by: \\
        $\phi_i(N,v) = \sum_{S \subseteq N \backslash \left\{i\right\} } \frac{|S|! (|N|-|S|-1)!}{|N|!} (v(S \cup \left\{i\right\}) - v(S))$
    \end{definition}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Some properties}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The core may not always be non-empty
        \item Shapley value always exists and is unique.
        \item When the valuation function is {\color{red}superadditive}, the Shapley value is {\color{red}individually rational}, i.e., it is an imputation.
        \item When the valuation function is {\color{red}convex}, the Shapley value is also group rational, hence, it is in the {\color{red}core}.
        \item A convex game has a non-empty core
        \item There are other well-known solution concepts: The bargaining set, The nucleolus and The nucleolus.

\subsection{Research Activities Goal}
\begin{frame}{Research Activities Goal}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Analyzing other cooperative solution concepts such as Kernel
        and Nucleolus where payoff division is guaranteed to exist and may
        have optimal results.

        \item Applying other valuation function in our scenarios using for
        instance Weighted Voting Games (WCG) in order to develop a
        multiple weighted algorithm to find best coalition structures
        satisfying different weights on each community.

        \item Analyzing the impact of Q-learning and reinforcement
        learning on the performance of our model.

        \item Developing an approximation algorithm for shapely value
        payoff distribution vector in community setting.

        \item Developing a community membership algorithm technique for
        our agents in "incomplete information" settings.

        %\item Developing an open source, Java based Tool, with UI for
        %solving Core and Shapely solution concepts based on different
        %input valuation functions.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Representation and Complexity issues}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Core and Shapley value are combinatorial problems.
        \item Input size is exponential.
        \item Compact or succinct representation of coalition games. A representation so that the input size is a polynomial in the number of agents.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Induced subgraph games}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An induced subgraph game is a coalitional game defined by an undirected weighted graph $G = (V,W)$ where $V$ is the set of vertices and $W : V \rightarrow V$ is the set of edges weights. For $(i,j) \in V^2$, $w_{ij}$ is the weight of the edge between $i$ and $j$.
        \item $N = V$
        \item for all $C \subseteq N, v(C) = \sum_{(i,j) \in C} w_{ij}$
        \item {\color{red}Space Complexity:} Using an adjacency matrix, we need to provide $n^2$ entries.
        \item {\color{red}Convexity:} If all the weights are nonnegative then the game is convex.
        \item {\color{red}Shapley Value:} $\phi_i(N,v) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{(i,j) \in N^2 | i \neq j}w_{ij}$
        \item This is {\color{red}not complete}. Many TU games cannot be represented by a induced subgraph game
