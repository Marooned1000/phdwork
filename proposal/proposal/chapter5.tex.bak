\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this chapter, we describe the phases of our plan for exploring the research challenges and investigating the research issues identified in Chapter 4. This chapter also includes research methodology and future publication plan.

\section {Conclusion}

In this report, we proposed a cooperative game theory-based model
for the aggregation of web services within communities. The goal
of our services is to maximize efficiency by collaborating and
forming stable coalitions. Our method considers stability and
fairness for all web services within a community and offers an
applicable mechanism for membership requests and selection of web
services. The ultimate goal is to increase revenue by improving
user satisfaction, which comes from the ability to perform more
tasks with high quality. Simulation results show that our,
polynomial in complexity, approximation algorithms provide web
services and community owners with applicable and near-optimal
decision making mechanisms.

As future work, we would like to perform more analytical and
theoretical analysis on the convexity condition and also minimal $\epsilon$ values in \emph{$\epsilon$-core} solution concepts based on the
characteristic function in web service applications. From web service perspective, the
work can be extended to consider web service compositions where a
group of web services having different set of skills cooperate to
perform composite tasks. Also bargaining theory from cooperating
game theory concepts can be used to help web services resolve the
instability and unfairness issues by side payments.
