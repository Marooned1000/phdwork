\begin{definition}{\emph{[Preference Level].}} \label{preferenceLevel}
The preference level of a nonempty subset $\gamma$ of $\Gamma$ denoted by level $(\gamma)$ is the number of the highest numbered
layer which has a member in $\gamma$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
Let $\Gamma = \Gamma_1 \bigcup \Gamma_2 $ with $\Gamma_1$ = $\{ a, b\}$ and $\Gamma_2$ = $\{ c,d \}$ and $\gamma = \{a\}$ and
$\gamma\prime = \{a,d\}$. We have: level$(\gamma) = 1$ and level$(\gamma\prime) = 2$.
\end{example}
