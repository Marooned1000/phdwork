\section{Coalition Games}
\subsection{Cooperative Game Theory}

\begin{frame}{Cooperative Game Theory}
  \begin{itemize}
     \item In game theory, a cooperative game is a game where groups of players $``coalitions''$ may enforce cooperative behaviour, hence the game is a competition between coalitions of players, rather than between individual players.
    \item Cooperation to perform a set of tasks that requires different expertise.
    \item Agents do not have enough resource on their own to perform the tasks.
    \item Examples:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Robots have the ability to move objects in a plant, but multiple robots are required to move a heavy box.
        \item Transportation domain: agents are trucks, trains, airplanes, ships... a task is a good to be transported.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Issues:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Coalition formation.
            \item Rewarding members when a task is completed.
        \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% frame14 Background and Literature Review %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Cooperative Game Theory}
    \begin{itemize}
         \item Cooperative games are a branch of game theory that models cooperation or collaboration between agents within coalitions.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{definition} [Coalition]~\\
       We have a population $N$ of $n$ agents, A coalition $C$ is a set of agents: $C \in 2^N$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $N$ is the set of all agents (or players)
            \item $v:2^N \rightarrow R$ is the \emph{valuation function}. For $C \subseteq N$, $v(C)$ is the value obtained by the coalition $C$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{definition}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Problem:} Given a game $(N,v)$, and assuming all agents in $N$ want to cooperate, how to distribute the gain among the agents?
        \item \textbf{Solution:} a payoff distribution $x \in R^n$ that provides a value to individual agents.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item What are the interesting properties that $x$ should satisfy?
            \item How to determine the payoff vector $x$?
        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{An Example}

    \begin{center}
        $N = \{1,2,3\}$ \\
        $v(\{1\}) = 0, v(\{2\}) = 0, v(\{3\}) = 0$ \\
        $v(\{1,2\}) = 90$ \\
        $v(\{1,3\}) = 80$ \\
        $v(\{2,3\}) = 70$ \\
        $v(\{1,2,3\}) = 105$ \\
    \end{center}

    What should we do?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item form $\{1,2,3\}$ and share equally $(35,35,35)$?
        \item 3 can say to 1 ``let's form $\{1,3\}$ and share (40,0,40)''
        \item 2 can say to 1 ``let's form $\{1,2\}$ and share (45,45,0)''
        \item 3 can say to 2 ``OK, let's form $\{2,3\}$ and share (0,46,24)''
        \item 1 can say to 2 and 3, ``fine! $\{1,2,3\}$ and (33,47,25)''
        \item ...what is a good solution?
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Transferable and Non Transferable Utility Games}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Games with Transferable Utility (TU games)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Utility is worth the same for all agents.
            \item Utility can be {\color{red} compared} or {\color{red} transferred} between agents.
            \item Irrespective of the division of the coalitional payoff.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item In that case members of the coalition enjoy the same total utility.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}


        \begin{definition} [Valuation or Characteristic Function]\label{dfn:valuationfunction}
            A \emph{valuation function v} associates a real number $v(C)$ to any subset $C \subseteq N$, i.e., $v:2^N \rightarrow R$ \\
            A {\color{blue}\emph{TU game}} is a pair $(N,v)$ where $N$ is a set of agents and where $v$ is a valuation function.
        \end{definition}



        \item \textbf{Games with Non Transferable Utility (NTU games)} \\
            Agents have different preferences over coalitions and rewards. Non-monetary rewards, i.e. item allocation type of problems where items have different values for different players.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item We all want to work together and get $v(N)$, but we all have different views about how to share the fruits of our work. We can use the values of other coalitions as arguments in favor of a distribution.
        \item A condition for a coalition to form:
            {\color{blue}all} agents prefer to be in it. i.e., none of the participants wishes she were in a different coalition or by herself {\color{blue} $\Rightarrow Stability$ }
        \item The {\color{blue} core} is a stability concept for which no agents prefer to deviate to form a different coalition.

    The core relates to the stability of the grand coalition: \\ No group of agents has any incentive to change coalition.
    \begin{definition}[$Core$ of a Game $(N,v)$]\label{dfn:core}
        Let $(N,v)$ be a cooperative game, and assume they form the coalition $N$. The core of $(N,v)$ is the set:
        \vspace{0.1cm}
        \begin{center}
            $Core(N,v) = \{x \in R^n | x$ is a group rational imputation$\}$

    \begin{definition} [Marginal Contribution]\label{dfn:marginalcontribution}
        The {\color{blue}marginal contribution} of agent $i$ for a coalition $C \subseteq N \backslash \{i\}$ is $mc_i(C) = v(C \cup \{i\}) - v(C)$
    \end{definition}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item By considering average marginal contribution over all possible subsets of coalitions, we can achieve a fair distribution.\\
        \item Let $\prod(N)$ denote the set of all permutations of the sequence $(1,...n)$. Therefore: $\phi_i(N,v) = \frac{\sum_{\sigma \in \phi_i(N)}}{mc(\sigma)}$
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{definition} [Shapley Value]\label{dfn:shapleyvalue}
        Given a coalitional game $(N,v)$, the Shapley value of player $i$ is given by: \\
        $\phi_i(N,v) = \sum_{S \subseteq N \backslash \left\{i\right\} } \frac{|S|! (|N|-|S|-1)!}{|N|!} (v(S \cup \left\{i\right\}) - v(S))$

    \begin{definition} [Excess of a coalition]\label{dfn:marginalcontribution}
        Let (N,v) be a $TU$ game, $C \subseteq N$ be a coalition, and $x$ be a payoff distribution over $N$. The excess $e(C,x)$ of coalition $C$ at $x$ is the quantity $e(C,x) = v(C) - x(C)$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Example:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item let $N={1,2,3}, C={1,2}, v({1,2})=8, x=(3,2,5)$
            \item $e(C,x)=v({1,2})-(x_1 + x_2)=8-(3+2)=3.$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Excess of a coalition}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item We can interpret a positive excess $(e(C,x) > 0)$ as the amount of dissatisfaction or {\color{blue} complaint} of the members of $C$ from the allocation x.
        \item We can use the excess to define the core:
        \begin{center}
            $Core(N,v)=\{x \in R^n |$ $x$ $is$ $an$ $imputation$ $and$ $\forall C \subseteq N, e(C,x) \leq 0\}$

\begin{frame}{Excess of a coalition: lexicographical order}

    \begin{definition} [lexicographical order $\geq_{lex}$]\label{dfn:lexorder}
        Let $\geq_{lex}$ denote the lexicographical ordering of $R^m$,
        $\forall(x,y) \in R^m, x \geq y$ $iff$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $x=y$ or
            \item $\exists t$ $1 \leq t \leq m$ and $\forall i$ $1 \leq i < t$ $x_i = y_i$ and $x_t > y_t$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{definition}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Example:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item let $\{1, 1, 0,-1,-2,-3,-3\} \geq_{lex} \{1, 0, 0, 0,-2,-3,-3\}$
        \end{itemize}
        \item Let $l$ be a sequence of $m$ reals. We denote by {\color{blue} $l^*$} the {\color{blue} reordering} of {\color{blue} $l$} in {\color{blue} decreasing} order.
        \item In the example, $e(x) = \{3,-3,-2,-1, 1, 1,0\}$ and then $e(x)^* = \{1, 1, 0,-1,-2,-3,-3\}$.
        \item Hence, we can say that $y$ is better than $x$ by writing $e(x)^* \geq e(y)^*$

\begin{frame}{Problem Formulation and Modeling}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Communities of web services are robust service providers with well established market share and reputation.
        \item The community is characterized by a request rate $R_C$.
        \item Web services can perform tasks with some throughput rate ($Th_{ws}$).
        \item Web services come with different values of $QoS_{ws}$ for different metrics.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Task Distribution}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Our model uses a slightly modified \emph{weighted fair queuing} method for task distribution rather than Contract-Net.
        \item All the input flow is multiplexed among different web services with weights proportional to their throughput value ($Th_{ws}$).
        \item Queues will happen if $R_C$ is more than the summation of web services throughput.
        \item Weighted task rate: $R_C \times \frac{Th_{ws}}{\sum_{ws}{Th_{ws}}}$ or $Th_{ws}$
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Improving Community Stability}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The core may not always be non-empty, core is a strong condition.
        \item The optimal solution concepts will attract only enough services satisfying input task rate, not more.
        \item In case of web service failure, a portion of tasks will not be handled efficiently until replacement is found.
        \item By imposing cost on deviation or subsiding the community, its possible to attract more web services and keep the community stable.
        \item Will be cost efficient in case of web service failure, or for replacing web services dropping in QoS metrics as they advertised.
        \item \emph{Taxation} would need agreement between all communities (needs a centralized approach), however \emph{subsiding} can be done within communities in distributed manner.
