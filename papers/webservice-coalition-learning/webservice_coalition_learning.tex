% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***
% *** with production work. IEEE's font choices can trigger bugs that do  ***
% *** not appear when using other class files.                            ***
% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/




% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
% The Computer Society usually requires 10pt for submissions.
%
\documentclass[10pt,journal,cspaper,compsoc]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[12pt,journal,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  % \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  % \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex

\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amssymb,amsmath}

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%\usepackage[tight,normalsize,sf,SF]{subfigure}
%\else
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
%\fi
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. Computer Society papers
% use a larger font and \sffamily font for their captions, hence the
% additional options needed under compsoc mode. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%  \usepackage[font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%  \usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{O}{ver} the past years, online services have become important part of many scalable business applications. The increasing reliance on online service providers has significantly influenced the way web services are engineered. Therefore, given the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the Internet, delivering high quality services is still a critical and challenging issue. One practical solution that delivers high quality service is utilizing intelligent decision making agents. These agents are aimed at maximizing gain by exploring best ways of providing services that satisfy end users. However, agent-based web services are functionally limitted in the sense that they cannot handle large number of requests at the same time, otherwise their quality of provided service would diminish. The recent developments attempted to shift web services from passive model in the form of individual components to autonomous and group-based components that follow common goals. In group-based models, interaction, composition, and cooperation are the key challenges \cite{ICWS2011-1, SCC2011-1, journals/mags/BaldoniBM10, journals/jcss/CasadoYT13} that have direct impact on group's overall performance in achieving common goals. All that being said, the concept of \emph{community} of web services has been emerged that gathers services having similar functionality but distinct non-functional properties \cite{Zeng:2003:QDW:775152.775211, Paik:2005:TSS:2229263.2230038, Medjahed05adynamic, 10.1109/ARES.2008.7}. A \emph{community} of web service runs continuous performance assessment functions that regulate web services' interactions and manage their composition and cooperation.

The advantages of community of Web services is that the community facilitates the discovery of web services and as community provides better quality services compared to passive models with individual components. In other words, communities act as abstract web services, communicating with external entities via same standard protocols that a normal web services employs. But they requlate the service process via sophisticated internal communication protocols that result in providing a service out of combined work of a number of web services. The down side to communities is the management complexity that involves finding/inviting individual web services and managing the overall quality as combined work done by web services that although have similar functionality, but have different attitudes. Interacting with communities of web services, users send their requests to the coordinators of the community, which plays the role of the community representative or access point. The community coordinator in \emph{community centralized} architecture is responsible for task recieve/delivery issues. Moreover, as community representative, it verifies credentials of new web services before accepting them to join the community as well as firing web services, which do not add enough value to the community.  

Recent work have emphasized on motivation and benefits of communities of web services [references]. This is due to the fact that communities facilitate discovery of web services, improve the Quality of Service (QoS), and help individual services find better market share and opportunities. Now there is a twofold challenge that is still not addressed: (1) the first challenge is community development, which is finding the right web service for the community, satisfying all web services and community coordinators involved within the community; and (2) the second challenge is from individual web service side in the sense that a web service seeks for communities to interact with and obtain best outcome. Towards addressing these research problems, there have been a number of proposals. Some of these works propose complex models on demand algorithms \cite{DBLP:conf/IEEEscc/LimTMB12, 10.1109/TSC.2012.12, 10.1109/TSC.2014.2312940} to effectively find target points. But they have to simplify the algorithm by limited parameters in order to make it feasible and algorithm executable. Simplified problems some times negatively influence the outcome in the sense that simplifying the constraints may cause ignoring important aspects of the problem. For example \cite{10.1109/TSC.2012.12} proposes a simple egalitarian way of distributing gain, which completely ignores gain for collaborative work instead of complex shapely-value. This model considers gain for all subset of agents working together, which basically ignores the most important criteria of finding optimal group. Other category of related work exists which they do not focus on all parties involved within the community \cite{DBLP:conf/IEEEscc/KhosravifarABT11}. 
%And some other work which do not focus on rationality on web services or communities involved [refrences]. 
These solutions generally suffer from high complexity, which makes decision making impossible in an on-demand fashion, or they simplify important aspects to make it practical in real world hurting the decision making performance. 

In this paper, we introduce MLISA (Machine Learning-based Intelligent Service Agents) community framework that operates based on a trained model that regulates web service agents' decision making process in terms of cooperating with one another. This model uses the trained data in the form of information obtained from large number of web services regarding their single and cooperative utilities as well as environmental parameters such as demand, service quality, etc. The training model deploys logistic regression algorithm to build hypothesis function that can thoroughly address the aforementioned research problems. Our findings show that communities of web services can efficiently find the appropriate web service to invite cooperating with them as well as a single web service can find best communities to target joining them. In further details, after being trained, web services get to compute expectations as utilities they would gain while cooperating with communities of different characteristics. In contrast, communities can consider the training into account and analyze the characteristics of different individual web services and make prudent decisions while inviting a web service to join or accepting a join inquiry initiated from a web service. In general, MLISA equips web services with efficient methods of foreseeing how their choices of actions would impact their long-term and short-term goals, therefore opting for best decision available. 

In further details, MLISA is applicable for any sort of intelligent agent-based model. To effectively train web services, we used real data set (information about the data set) to extract web services' individual characteristics and used them to measure outcomes when they cooperate with one another. Engineering and extracting these features, we gathered functional and cooperative features for both individual web services and communities in 60 different time slots. We were able to investigate the path a web service might take to achieve the best utility out of effective interaction with others. All paths and the outcomes are labeled to be utilized in training model. Using cross validation set, web services are able to compute optimal hypothesis function (using logistic regression) that can be used to predict outcome out of cooperative work with other individual web services or communities. Our findings show that web services equipped with MLISA have by far better outcome in the form of cooperative service providers than the ones that either do not cooperate or randomly find communities to join.

%- High demand on online services has created a massive business competition. For example, nowadays users are provided with multiple choices of web services offering local places information such as coffees, venues, and shops nearby a geographic position. It is hard for new web services to find their customers and be visible for end users amongst hundreds or thousands of other available services, even if they provide a high quality of service. Hence, the concept of communities of web services provides them with the chance of joining a platform with an established market share and reputation. However, it is crucial for a community manager to consider many factors when inviting or accepting new members. For example,  this may hurt the community stability.

%- The high competition within the services industry requires applications to use reliable and high quality online service providers. If the user were to check a web site or run an application on her mobile device upon having downtime, or having high response delay or encountering any non-satisfying quality metric, she will instantly remove the application, which is a huge business concern for application providers. For example, if a user installs a ticketing application on her mobile device and the application is not using high quality service providers, the user would instantly uninstall the application, which has an extremely negative impact on the visibility of the application.

\section{The Model}\label{s:preliminaries}
In this section, we first present the architecture of MLISA. We explore the characterestics of intelligent service agents and the features we extract for training. To do this, in the following, we discuss some preliminaries.

\subsection{Web Services}\label{s:ws}

Over the past years, online services have become part of standard daily life of people around the globe. Many modern applications rely on web services from different providers. For instance, many mobile and tablet applications which have limited storage and processing power are merely interfaces aggregating different information from online services. Examples are vast, weather forecasting, ticket selling, shopping apps, local maps and places searching.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defines web services as follows: ``software system designed to support interpretable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. It has an interface described in a machine-processable format (specifically WSDL). Other systems interact with the web service in a manner prescribed by its description using SOAP messages, typically conveyed using HTTP with XML serialization in conjunction with other Web-related standards''. When developers declare a new web service, it will be
discovered based on its description that fully discloses its functionalities. Developers also have to declare a public interface and a readable documentation to help other developers when integrating different services \cite{w3cwsdl}. Nowadays, web API standards which do not require XML-based web service protocols like SOAP and WSDL are also emerging. They are also called REST (representational state transfer) services which are moving towards simpler communication protocols. 
%They are not restricted 
%to XML formats, recently JSON, a human readable and simpler format 
%is becoming popular among online service providers.

We are not going to delve into engineering details of online web service implementation and its protocols in this proposal. We are interested in web services from their business model perspective. Service providers usually charge end users for services they provide. For example, Google has listed their pricing and plans for wide range of services they provide on their web service console page\footnote{https://code.google.com/apis/console}.

In our research work, we abstract web services as rational agents\footnote{The term rational is used here in the sense that web services are utility maximizers} providing services to end users. They aim to maximize their individual income  by receiving enough requests from end users. In order to increase their revenues, web services seek for more tasks if they have the capacity and throughput to do so. Web services can join communities to have better efficiency by collaborating with others, to have access to broad market share, and to have opportunity of receiving a bigger task pool from end users. Furthermore, the high reliance on web services has increased quality expectations from end users. Communities of web services can provide higher availability, performance, reliability, and recovery for end users.

\subsection{Web Service Communities}\label{s:wsc}

The community of web services is essentially a virtual group of web services having similar and complementary functionalities. Communities aggregate web services and communicate with other entities such as UDDI registries and users, using identical protocols as single web services. Web services join communities to increase their utility by having a larger market share and task pool. Community coordinators are responsible for community development, managing membership requests from web services and distributing user tasks among the community members. Community coordinators try to attract quality web services for joining and keep the community as stable and productive as possible to gain better reputation and user satisfaction, which results in having a higher market share for the community. The way the web services reside inside communities and how communities of web services are engineered is described comprehensively in \cite{DBLP:journals/ijebr/MaamarSTBB09}.

%\begin{figure*}%[!t]
%\centerline{\includegraphics[width=6.25in]{figures/community.eps}}
%\caption{Architecture of web service communities}
%\label{fig_community}
%\end{figure*}

\subsection{Internal Features}\label{s:if}

With a group of web services having identical or similar functionalists, QoS metrics provide nonfunctional characteristics for the optimal candidate selection. Web service quality metrics have been presented in \cite{Ardagna:2007:ASC:1263152.1263531,Menasce:2002:QIW:613357.613758,10.1109/ISSRE.2011.17}, we have adopted the most representative QoS properties of web services which highly influence the utility of web services.

\begin{itemize}

  \item \emph{Throughput} is the rate at which a service can process requests. QoS measures can include the maximum throughput or a function that describes how throughput varies with load intensity. Throughput is a real number in the range $[0, 1]$.
	
	\item \emph{Availability} is the percentage of time that a service is operating.
	The probability that the service operation is accessible. Availability is also a real number in the range $[0, 1]$.
	
	\item \emph{Execution Time} is the time a service takes to respond to various types of requests. 
	%is the expected delay between the time instant when a request is sent and the time when the result is obtained. 
	Execution time is measured in seconds. Execution time can be affected by load intensity, which can be measured in terms of arrival rates (such as requests per second) or number of concurrent requests. This internal feature is a positive integer. 
	
	%\item \emph{Data Quality} The ability of a data collection to meet user requirements , defined as the proximity of a value v returned by web service to a value considered as correct. The measure of data quality is considered here as a real number in the range [0, 1], where 1 represents the most desirable score.
	
\end{itemize}


\subsection{External Features}\label{s:ef}

The quantitative values of quality metrics need some benchmark values to represent their goodness. In other words, without some benchmark values it would be hard for web services to identify their goals, and how good or bad they would perform at any specific value of these metrics. Therefore we have introduced two external features to assess web services getting better estimate of their standing within other web services.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{External Parameter 1} $(exp_1)$. is an estimate of how close the web service's \emph{execution time} is to other web services. It is the difference between web service's \emph{response time} metric and the maximum value of response time of web services, that the web service has recently gathered information about.
	\item \emph{External Parameter 2} $(exp_2)$ is a comparison of the web service's rate of performing tasks to other competing web services. It is the difference between web service's \emph{throughput} metric and the maximum value of throughput of web services, that the web service has recently gathered information about.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Join Challenge}\label{s:tjc}
Sometimes web services can increase their overall utility by starting a collaboration with other web services as communities. This collaboration can help them with better ways of sharing resources, higher reputation, better market share and wider visibility. Web services and communities come with different internal and external parameters and long-term outcome is dependent on these parameters. 

The goal of all parties involved in the community is to maximize their long-term outcome of their collaboration. Web services need to be utilized with a selection strategy to choose from all the different possible collaboration groups they can form and also an estimation method for evaluating the long-term gain of joining different possible communities. Web services need to experiment different possible collaborative groups with other web services in order to be able to estimate their gain over time. However with high number of possible communities and many other business restrictions its not possible to test run collaboration with random web services. Even if a linear approximate function for estimating utility base on community web services' parameters is adopted, the exponential \footnote{Bell number: $http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_number$} growth rate of possible number of partition of web services into communities, would make any brute-force type algorithm for best community selection strategy intractable and non-practical in real-world applications.

\section{Related Work}\label{s:related_work}

*******SOME PARTS IS TEMPRORARY COMBINED FROM PREVIOUS WORKS*******
In \cite{DBLP:journals/internet/BenatallahSD03}, Benatallah et al.
defined communities as \emph{Service Containers} which aggregate
substitutable web services providing a common functionality (same
set of operations). They abstracted \emph{Service Containers} as
web services which are created, advertised, discovered and invoked
just as elementary web services. The \emph{Container} is
considered as a manager which is responsible for web service
selection upon receiving a request on run-time. The authors have
proposed a scoring service based on non-functional requirements of
the request and web service capabilities to dynamically chose the
web service to perform the requested task. A similar concept was
proposed by Maamar et al. in
\cite{DBLP:journals/ijebr/MaamarSTBB09}. The authors introduced
web service communities as a collection of web services with a
common functionality but different QoS properties. A community
manager, upon receiving a request, delegates the request to one of
its current members. The choice is based on the performance
history and quality metrics of each web service. The authors have
proposed an efficient global web service selection algorithm in
order to approach quality constraints and preferences for
composite services which require aggregation of different types of
services to satisfy the user.

Benslimane et al. \cite{Liris-2770} have proposed a multi-layer
approach grouping similar Web services into communities and having
an interface implemented as an abstract web service for accessing
the community on top of the community layer. The interactions
between composite, management and community layers and the
bindings are performed by a generic driver called Open Software
Connectivity (OSC).

In \cite{managing-hela-jalel}, Limam and Akaichi have proposed web
service communities with centralized access across distributed web
services. They have proposed a framework for web service
management, query resolution among communities and a query caching
mechanism executed by the manager to improve the performance of
query resolution process among many distributed communities. The
key idea is to cache previous computed results for answering
future queries.


Maamar et al. initially in \cite{conf/webist/MaamarLBTS07} and
then comprehensively in \cite{DBLP:journals/ijebr/MaamarSTBB09}
proposed an architecture utilizing \emph{Contract-Net} protocol
for engineering task distribution within communities of web
services. The protocol is centrally executed by the community
manager. This architecture has been further developed in
\cite{CSTintercommunity, conf/IEEEscc/BenharrefSBB11,
conf/IEEEscc/KhosravifarBMMT10, conf/aina/LimTM11}. Two types of
roles have been distinguished for community members: masters and
slaves. Master web services and community managers that lead
communities and are responsible for membership management. They
can invite and convince slave web services to join the community,
and attract new slave web services to their communities by
awarding them better payoff. Moreover, they can eject some slave
members from the community to improve its overall reputation if
these members are misbehaving or cannot provide the promised QoS.

In \cite{Medjahed05adynamic}, Medjahed and Bouguettaya have
developed a community as a ``cluster'' that groups Web services
based on a specific area of interest. All web services in a given
community share the same functionality. These communities are
created by \emph{third party community providers} which use the
\emph{community ontology} as a template and define a set of
operations that all web services within a community should
provide. Using semantic analysis on web service operations, web
services either find and join a community with similar
functionality or create a new operation description for a new
community. The authors have described the concept of
\emph{community agents} associated to \emph{community providers}.
A community agent is responsible, among other things, of the
registration of services with the community. An example of a
community that provides health care services to senior citizens
has been used. In this example, a governmental entity is needed to
check the health care standards used by the members before
authorizing them to be part of the community. Such a central
entity is represented by the community agent. Thus, community
agents are playing the role of community managers. In a close work
\cite{Zeng:2003:QDW:775152.775211}, Zeng et al. have described a
global planning selection algorithm and a delegation algorithm to
be run when a request to execute an operation is received by the
community. This needs a central entity to run those algorithms.
Such entity plays the same role as the community coordinator or
manager.

Most of the recent work on communities of services are either
user-centric and focus on user satisfaction
\cite{Chun02user-centricperformance} or system-centric and focus
on the whole system throughput, performance and utilization. There
are many contributions in distributed, grid, cluster and cloud
services which are system-centric. However, in real world
environments and applications, both users and service providers
are self-interested agents, aiming to maximize their own profit.
In those environments, both parties (users and services) will
collaborate as long as they are getting more benefits and payoff.

In this direction, recently \cite{DBLP:conf/IEEEscc/LimTMB12,
DBLP:conf/IEEEscc/KhosravifarABT11, 10.1109/TSC.2012.12} proposed
mechanisms to help users and services maximize their gain. A
two-player non-cooperative game between web services and community
master was introduced in
\cite{DBLP:conf/IEEEscc/KhosravifarABT11}. In this game-theoretic
model, the strategies available to a web service when facing a new
community are requesting to join the community, accepting the
master's invitation to join the community, or refusing the
invitation to join. The set of strategies for communities are
inviting the web service or refusing the web service's join
request. Based on their capacity, market share and reputation, the
two players have different sets of utilities over the strategy
profiles of the game. The main limits of this game model are: 1)
its consideration of only three quality parameters, while the
other factors are simply ignored; and 2) the non-consideration of
the web services already residing within the community. The game
is only between the community master and the new web service, and
the inputs from all the other members and their influence on the
master's decision are simply ignored. The consideration of those
inputs and this influence factor is a significant issue as
existing web services can lose utility or payoff because of the
new member, which can result in an unhealthy and unstable group.
The problem comes from the fact that the existing members should
collaborate with the new web services, so probably their
performance as a group can suffer. Existing members may even
deviate and try to join other communities if they are unsatisfied.
Those considerations of forming stable and efficient coalitions
are the main contributions of our paper.

In \cite{DBLP:conf/IEEEscc/LimTMB12}, a 3-way satisfaction approach
for selecting web services has been proposed. In this approach,
the authors proposed a web service selection process that the
community masters can use. The approach considers the efficiency
of all the three involved parties, namely users, web services and
communities. In this work, it is shown how the gains of these
parties are coupled together using a linear optimization process.
However, the optimization problem in this solution tends to
optimize some parameters considering all web services regardless
of their efficiency and contribution to the community's welfare.
Moreover, there are no clear thresholds for accepting or rejecting
new web services. The solution of the optimization problem could,
for instance, suggest web services already residing within the
community to increase or decrease their capacity to cover up the
weakness of other parties in the system. However, a high
performing web service could deviate anytime it finds itself
unsatisfied within the community instead of adjusting its service
parameters.

In \cite{10.1109/TSC.2012.12}, a cooperative scheme among
autonomous web services based on coalitional game theory has been
introduced. The authors have proposed an interesting algorithm to
reach individually stable coalition partition for web services in
order to maximize their efficiency. The communities choose new web
services on the promise that it would benefit the community
without decreasing any other web service's income. In the proposed
model, the worth of community is evaluated with high emphasis on
the availability metric and considering price and cost values
only. The community structure is based on a coordination chain,
where a web service is considered as a \emph{primary} web service
and the community task-distribution method initially invokes the
primary web service and only if the primary web service is
unavailable, the method invokes the next backup web services as
they are ordered in the coordination chain. We believe that this
coordination chain limits the cooperation power as it introduces a
sort of hierarchy. However, in pure and open cooperative models,
such as the one we propose in this paper, active cooperation
activities engaging simultaneously many agents so that they can
perform the tasks more efficiently are being used. Moreover, if
the availability is high, which is the case nowadays with the
recent advancements in cloud and hardware infrastructures, the
backup web services will end-up having a very low chance of
getting jobs, especially the ones further in the chain. This will
results in a considerable waste of web services capabilities.

% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
% the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could create
% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)
%\begin{biography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{mshell}}]{Michael Shell}
% or if you just want to reserve a space for a photo:

% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.

%\vfill

% Can be used to pull up biographies so that the bottom of the last one
% is flush with the other column.
