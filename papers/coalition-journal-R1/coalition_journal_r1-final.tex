% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***
% *** with production work. IEEE's font choices can trigger bugs that do  ***

% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/




% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
% The Computer Society usually requires 10pt for submissions.
%
\documentclass[10pt,journal,cspaper,compsoc]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[12pt,journal,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  % \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  % \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex

\usepackage{amsfonts,url}
\usepackage{amssymb,amsmath}
 \usepackage{comment}

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%\usepackage[tight,normalsize,sf,SF]{subfigure}
%\else
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
%\fi
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. Computer Society papers
% use a larger font and \sffamily font for their captions, hence the
% additional options needed under compsoc mode. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%  \usepackage[font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%  \usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks

% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

Web services are loosely-coupled business applications willing to
cooperate in distributed settings within different groups called
communities. Communities aim to provide web services with better
visibility, efficiency, market share and total payoff. A number of
mechanisms and models have been recently proposed to aggregate web
services and make them cooperate within their communities.
However, forming optimal and stable communities as coalitions to
maximize individual and group efficiency and income is yet to be
addressed. In this paper, we propose an efficient community
formation mechanism using cooperative game-theoretic techniques,
particularly Shapley value, core, $\epsilon$-core and convex
games. We propose a mechanism for community membership requests
and selections of web services under two scenarios: (1) there is
only one community and many web services aim to join it; and (2)
web services can join different established communities. The
ultimate objective is to develop a mechanism for web services to
form stable groups allowing them to maximize their efficiency and
generate near-optimal (welfare-maximizing) communities where a
taxation-based solution is being proposed. The theoretical and
extensive experimental results show that our algorithms provide
web services and community owners, in real-world-like
environments, with applicable and near-optimal decision making
mechanisms.

% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
% in the abstract anyway. In particular, the Computer Society does
% not want either math or citations to appear in the abstract.

\section{Introduction}\label{s:introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{O}{ver} the past years, online services have become
part of many scalable business applications. The increasing
reliance on web-based applications has significantly influenced
the way web services are engineered. Web services provide a set of
stateless software functions accessible at a network address over
the web. The recent developments are shifting web services from
passive and individual components to autonomous and group-based
components where interaction, composition, and cooperation are the
key challenges \cite{ICWS2011-1,SCC2011-1,Baldoni2010,Younas2013}.
The main objective is to achieve a seamless integration of
business processes, applications and web services. Delivering high
quality services considering the dynamic and unpredictable nature
of the Internet is still a very critical and challenging issue.

The need for highly available and responsive services has called
for grouping and collaborative mechanisms of loosely-coupled web
services, particularly in business settings
\cite{YuB13,Younas2012,LiuBWZ13}. The idea of grouping web
services within communities and the way those communities are
engineered so that web services can better collaborate have been
proposed and investigated in
\cite{DBLP:journals/ijebr/MaamarSTBB09,DBLP:journals/internet/BenatallahSD03,Rosario:2008:PQS:1512146.1512290}.
Communities are virtual groups of web services having similar or
complementary functionalities \cite{Zeng:2003:QDW:775152.775211,
Paik:2005:TSS:2229263.2230038,Medjahed05adynamic,10.1109/ARES.2008.7},
but probably different non-functional quality attributes, which
form the QoS parameters. Web service communities facilitate the
discovery of web services and also provide services with better
quality. When communities are used, users send their requests to
the coordinators of those communities, which play the role of
their representatives or access points. A community coordinator is
a particular service that takes in charge the verification of
credentials of new web services before accepting them to join the
community, inviting good web services to join the community,
firing bad web services if they do not perform as expected, etc.
The coordinator of a community is responsible for all the
operations related to the management of that community
infrastructure in terms of regulating the membership and insuring
that the overall performance is satisfactory. Unlike web services
that are members of the community, the coordinator does not offer
services directly to the users, it only forwards the requests to
the suitable members. The coordinator is created by the community
owner when the community is launched. Communities aim to provide
higher service availability and performance than what individual
web services can do. The high availability of services and the
community resilience to failure are guaranteed since web services
can cooperate and replace each other within the same community and
since there is no single point of failure in the communities
architecture.

\textbf{Motivations.} Communities of web services are then
collections of functionally similar autonomous web services
sharing a coordinator or service broker as manager which also
serves as the access point to the community. In this paper, we
advocate the idea of community as a way to group web services in
order to increase the total gain of all the members where each web
service gain is more than or equal to what this web service would
obtain being outside the community. This is because the community
can provide wider visibility, better market share, higher
reputation, and better way of sharing resources. Community is an
infrastructure and being part of it should benefit the web
service, but also the community as a whole.

As argued in \cite{CSTintercommunity}, members of a web services
community can either compete or cooperate. In this paper, we
stress the intra-community cooperation (i.e., among members of the
same community) for a better inter-community competition. The main
idea is that to form a stable community in terms of membership and
to have fair distribution of the total gain among the individual
members based on their contributions, cooperative game theory,
particularly the part of coalition games, provides a very suitable
framework. For instance, we cannot leverage the theory of repeated
games as a way to model the problem, because such a theory is
suitable for situations where web services are competing with each
other so they can learn the best response by playing the game
repeatedly. In fact, it has been proved that cooperation among
competitors is an effective business model
\cite{Chetty2003,Bucklin1993}. Several concrete examples in the
businesses world are following this model such as coalitions among
competitive airlines and coalitions in the automobile sector. For
the first example, three large and well known coalitions, called
alliances, are very active, namely Star
Alliance\footnote{\url{www.staralliance.com}} (includes 28 airline
members), SkyTeam\footnote{\url{www.skyteam.com}} (has 19
members), and Oneworld\footnote{\url{ www.oneworld.com}} (groups
13 members). Airlines of the same community are competing because
each one tries to maximize its utility by gaining more market
share. However, by sharing resources and market share and having
the option of service multi-hop air tickets combined from
different airlines, each airline member of a coalition can
increase its gain by collaborating. For the second example, the
coalition among PSA Peugeot Citro\"{e}n and Toyota that creates
Toyota Peugeot Citro\"{e}n Automobile
(TPCA)\footnote{\url{www.tpca.cz/en/}} has been very successful.
This coalition allowed the three competitors to share components
for a new city car while saving money on shared costs. Our model
of cooperation between competitor web services as coalitions
within communities follows these business models. The key question
we address is when such collaborations would be beneficial for all
the agents involved? For example the three airline alliances would
not gain anything by collaborating and sharing resources with
airlines of low reputation and quality. They will lose their
market and would rather stay away from this collaboration.
Therefore, no stable community can be formed between well
established and poor airlines.



Web services in the same community are independent and autonomous.
They are self-interest and utility maximizer agents, and behave
autonomously towards maximizing their own profits using our game
theory approach. They have the freedom to leave the community
anytime if they are not satisfied about the profit they are
making. Having a community manager, only means that the management
of the community infrastructure in terms of accepting new web
services and verifying the credentials of the members is
centralized. In other words, the coordinator does not manage web
services, but does manage the community. The manager does not
dictate what the web services should do and how they should
behave. In fact, because the community is an infrastructure that
hosts different web services, membership cannot be leaved open so
that any web service can join even those having poor quality and
bad reputation. A community is a system that should accept only
particular web services, and there should be a mechanism to
control the credentials of the members. In the real case of
airlines, the three aforementioned alliances are managed by
centralized entities:
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item Star Alliance is managed by a centralized company \emph{Star
Alliance Services
GmbH}\footnote{\url{www.staralliance.com/en/about/organisation/}};
%
\item SkyTeam has centralized core management team, \emph{SkyTeam
Central}\footnote{\url{http://www.skyteam.com/en/About-us/Organization/Management/}};
and
%
\item Oneworld is managed by its central alliance office, the
\emph{Oneworld Management Company}
(\emph{oMC})\footnote{\url{www.oneworld.com/news-information/oneworld-fact-sheets}}.
%
\end{itemize}
%
In all these alliances, accepting a new member or pending a member
is decided centrally. Regarding the second example, TPCA coalition
is also managed by a central management company based Czech
republic\footnote{\url{www.tpca.cz/en/about-us/management-tpca-en-us/}}.



\textbf{Contributions.} In this paper, we use game theory to
propose a cooperative game model for the aggregation of web
services within communities. The solution concepts of our
cooperative game seeks to find efficient ways of forming
coalitions (teams) of web services so that they can maximize their
gain and payoff, and distribute the gain in a fair way among all
the web services. Achieving fairness when the gain is distributed
among the community members is the main factor to keep the
coalition stable as no web service will expect to gain better by
deviating from the community. In other words, the coalition is
made efficient if all the members are satisfied. We analyze the
game model using two scenarios. The first one simply considers one
community and many web services interested to join it. The second
scenario, which generalizes the first one, includes the
possibility of joining different already established communities.
We first propose a representation function for communities of web
services based on their QoS attributes. By using this function, we
can evaluate the $worth$ of each community of web services. When
facing new membership requests, a typical community coordinator
checks whether the new coalition having the old and new set of web
services will keep the community stable or not. The community
coordinate will reject the membership requests if it finds out
that the new coalition would be unstable, preventing $any$ subset
of web services from gaining significantly more by deviating from
the community and joining other communities or forming new ones.
The computation of solutions for cooperative game theory problems
is combinatorial in nature and proven to be NP-complete
\cite{Algorithmic}, making this computation impractical in real
world applications. However, using the concepts of coalition
stability, we propose approximation algorithms running in
polynomial time providing web services and community coordinators
with applicable and near-optimal decision making mechanisms.

\section{Related Work}\label{s:related-work}

In \cite{DBLP:journals/internet/BenatallahSD03}, Benatallah et al.
defined communities as \emph{Service Containers} which aggregate
substitutable web services providing a common functionality (same
set of operations). They abstracted \emph{Service Containers} as
web services which are created, advertised, discovered and invoked
just as elementary web services. The \emph{Container} is
considered as a manager which is responsible for web service
selection upon receiving a request on run-time. The authors have
proposed a scoring service based on non-functional requirements of
the request and web service capabilities to dynamically chose the
web service to perform the requested task. A similar concept was
proposed by Maamar et al. in
\cite{DBLP:journals/ijebr/MaamarSTBB09}. The authors introduced
web service communities as a collection of web services with a
common functionality but different QoS properties. A community
manager, upon receiving a request, delegates the request to one of
its current members. The choice is based on the performance
history and quality metrics of each web service. The authors have
proposed an efficient global web service selection algorithm in
order to approach quality constraints and preferences for
composite services which require aggregation of different types of
services to satisfy the user.

Benslimane et al. \cite{Liris-2770} have proposed a multi-layer
approach grouping similar Web services into communities and having
an interface implemented as an abstract web service for accessing
the community on top of the community layer. The interactions
between composite, management and community layers and the
bindings are performed by a generic driver called Open Software
Connectivity (OSC).

In \cite{managing-hela-jalel}, Limam and Akaichi have proposed web
service communities with centralized access across distributed web
services. They have proposed a framework for web service
management, query resolution among communities and a query caching
mechanism executed by the manager to improve the performance of
query resolution process among many distributed communities. The
key idea is to cache previous computed results for answering
future queries.


Maamar et al. initially in \cite{conf/webist/MaamarLBTS07} and
then comprehensively in \cite{DBLP:journals/ijebr/MaamarSTBB09}
proposed an architecture utilizing \emph{Contract-Net} protocol
for engineering task distribution within communities of web
services. The protocol is centrally executed by the community
manager. This architecture has been further developed in
\cite{CSTintercommunity, conf/IEEEscc/BenharrefSBB11,
conf/IEEEscc/KhosravifarBMMT10, conf/aina/LimTM11}. Two types of
roles have been distinguished for community members: masters and
slaves. Master web services and community managers that lead
communities and are responsible for membership management. They
can invite and convince slave web services to join the community,
and attract new slave web services to their communities by
awarding them better payoff. Moreover, they can eject some slave
members from the community to improve its overall reputation if
these members are misbehaving or cannot provide the promised QoS.

In \cite{Medjahed05adynamic}, Medjahed and Bouguettaya have
developed a community as a ``cluster'' that groups Web services
based on a specific area of interest. All web services in a given
community share the same functionality. These communities are
created by \emph{third party community providers} which use the
\emph{community ontology} as a template and define a set of
operations that all web services within a community should
provide. Using semantic analysis on web service operations, web
services either find and join a community with similar
functionality or create a new operation description for a new
community. The authors have described the concept of
\emph{community agents} associated to \emph{community providers}.
A community agent is responsible, among other things, of the
registration of services with the community. An example of a
community that provides health care services to senior citizens
has been used. In this example, a governmental entity is needed to
check the health care standards used by the members before
authorizing them to be part of the community. Such a central
entity is represented by the community agent. Thus, community
agents are playing the role of community managers. In a close work
\cite{Zeng:2003:QDW:775152.775211}, Zeng et al. have described a
global planning selection algorithm and a delegation algorithm to
be run when a request to execute an operation is received by the
community. This needs a central entity to run those algorithms.
Such entity plays the same role as the community coordinator or
manager.

Most of the recent work on communities of services are either
user-centric and focus on user satisfaction
\cite{Chun02user-centricperformance} or system-centric and focus
on the whole system throughput, performance and utilization. There
are many contributions in distributed, grid, cluster and cloud
services which are system-centric. However, in real world
environments and applications, both users and service providers
are self-interested agents, aiming to maximize their own profit.
In those environments, both parties (users and services) will
collaborate as long as they are getting more benefits and payoff.

In this direction, recently \cite{DBLP:conf/IEEEscc/LimTMB12,
DBLP:conf/IEEEscc/KhosravifarABT11, 10.1109/TSC.2012.12} proposed
mechanisms to help users and services maximize their gain. A
two-player non-cooperative game between web services and community
master was introduced in
\cite{DBLP:conf/IEEEscc/KhosravifarABT11}. In this game-theoretic
model, the strategies available to a web service when facing a new
community are requesting to join the community, accepting the
master's invitation to join the community, or refusing the
invitation to join. The set of strategies for communities are
inviting the web service or refusing the web service's join
request. Based on their capacity, market share and reputation, the
two players have different sets of utilities over the strategy
profiles of the game. The main limits of this game model are: 1)
its consideration of only three quality parameters, while the
other factors are simply ignored; and 2) the non-consideration of
the web services already residing within the community. The game
is only between the community master and the new web service, and
the inputs from all the other members and their influence on the
master's decision are simply ignored. The consideration of those
inputs and this influence factor is a significant issue as
existing web services can lose utility or payoff because of the
new member, which can result in an unhealthy and unstable group.
The problem comes from the fact that the existing members should
collaborate with the new web services, so probably their
performance as a group can suffer. Existing members may even
deviate and try to join other communities if they are unsatisfied.
Those considerations of forming stable and efficient coalitions
are the main contributions of our paper.

In \cite{DBLP:conf/IEEEscc/LimTMB12}, a 3-way satisfaction approach
for selecting web services has been proposed. In this approach,
the authors proposed a web service selection process that the
community masters can use. The approach considers the efficiency
of all the three involved parties, namely users, web services and
communities. In this work, it is shown how the gains of these
parties are coupled together using a linear optimization process.
However, the optimization problem in this solution tends to
optimize some parameters considering all web services regardless
of their efficiency and contribution to the community's welfare.
Moreover, there are no clear thresholds for accepting or rejecting
new web services. The solution of the optimization problem could,
for instance, suggest web services already residing within the
community to increase or decrease their capacity to cover up the
weakness of other parties in the system. However, a high
performing web service could deviate anytime it finds itself
unsatisfied within the community instead of adjusting its service
parameters.

In \cite{10.1109/TSC.2012.12}, a cooperative scheme among
autonomous web services based on coalitional game theory has been
introduced. The authors have proposed an interesting algorithm to
reach individually stable coalition partition for web services in
order to maximize their efficiency. The communities choose new web
services on the promise that it would benefit the community
without decreasing any other web service's income. In the proposed
model, the worth of community is evaluated with high emphasis on
the availability metric and considering price and cost values
only. The community structure is based on a coordination chain,
where a web service is considered as a \emph{primary} web service
and the community task-distribution method initially invokes the
primary web service and only if the primary web service is
unavailable, the method invokes the next backup web services as
they are ordered in the coordination chain. We believe that this
coordination chain limits the cooperation power as it introduces a
sort of hierarchy. However, in pure and open cooperative models,
such as the one we propose in this paper, active cooperation
activities engaging simultaneously many agents so that they can
perform the tasks more efficiently are being used. Moreover, if
the availability is high, which is the case nowadays with the
recent advancements in cloud and hardware infrastructures, the
backup web services will end-up having a very low chance of
getting jobs, especially the ones further in the chain. This will
results in a considerable waste of web services capabilities.

\section{Preliminaries}\label{s:preliminaries}

In this section, we discuss the parameters and preliminary
concepts that we use in the rest of the paper.

\subsection{The Architecture}

Our system consists of three main types of entities working
together:

\emph{1) Web services} are rational entities\footnote{The term
rational is used here in the sense that web services are
autonomous and utility maximizers} providing services to end
users. They aim to maximize their individual income by receiving
enough requests from end users. In order to increase their
revenue, web services seek for more tasks if they have the
capacity and throughput to do so. Web services can join
communities to have better efficiency by collaborating with
others, to have access to higher market share, and to have
opportunity of receiving a bigger task pool from end users.
Throughout this paper, in our equations, we refer to web services
as $ws$ and to the set of web services hosted by a given community
as $C$. To simplify the notation, sometimes we simply write $ws$
instead of $ws \in C$ to go through the elements $ws$ of the set
$C$, when $C$ can be understood from the context.

\emph{2) Community coordinators} are
representatives of the communities of web services and responsible
for their management. Communities receive requests from users and
aim to host a healthy set of web services to perform the required
tasks. They seek to maximize user satisfaction by having tasks
accomplished according to the desired QoS. In fact, higher user
satisfaction will bring more user requests and increase the market
share and revenue of the community.

\emph{3) Users} generate requests and try to find the best
available services. User satisfaction is abstracted as function of
quantity and quality of tasks accomplished by a given service.
Higher user satisfaction leads to higher trust and better
reputation of the community as a whole, which helps direct more
requests towards that community.

\subsection{Web Service Parameters}\label{ws_parameters}

Web services come with different quality of service parameters.
These parameters with a short description are listed in Table
\ref{qosws}.

\begin{table}[!t]
\centering
\caption{List of web service QoS parameters.}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c||c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Definition} \\
\hline\hline
$Availability$ & Probability of being available during \\
&a time frame \\
$Reliability$ & Probability of successfully handling \\
&requests during a timeframe\\
$Successability$ & Rate of successfully handled requests \\
$Throughput$ & Average rate of handling requests \\
$Latency$ & Average response round-trip time\\
$Capacity$ & Amount of resources available\\
$Cost$ & Mean service fee \\
$Regulatory$ & Compliance with standards, law and rules\\
$Security$ & Quality of confidentiality \\
&and non-repudiation\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{qosws}
\end{table}

We adopted a real world dataset \cite{DBLP:conf/smc/Al-MasriM09a}
which has aggregated and normalized each of these parameters to a
real value between 0 and 1. Since requests are not shared among
web services and are distributed among all of them inside a
community, each one of them comes with a given QoS denoted by
$(QoS_{ws})$. We assume that $(QoS_{ws})$ is obtained by a certain
aggregation function of the parameters considered in Table
\ref{qosws}. We use this quality output later in evaluating the
community \emph{worth} or \emph{payoff} function.

\subsection{Web Service Communities}\label{webservice-communities}

Figure \ref{fig_community} represents the architecture of web
service communities. The community is essentially a virtual group
of web services having similar and complementary functionalities.
Communities aggregate web services and communicate with other
entities such as UDDI registries and users, using identical
protocols as single web services. Web services join communities to
increase their utility by having a larger market share and task
pool. Community coordinators are
responsible for community development, managing membership
requests from web services and distributing user tasks among the
community members. Community coordinators try to attract quality
web services for joining and keep the community as stable and
productive as possible to gain better reputation and user
satisfaction, which results in having a higher market share for
the community. The way the web services reside inside communities
and how communities of web services are engineered is described
comprehensively in \cite{DBLP:journals/ijebr/MaamarSTBB09}.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Cooperative Game Concepts}
The theory of cooperative games is a branch of game theory that
studies strategies of self-interested entities or agents in a
setting where those agents can increase their payoff by binding
agreements and cooperating in groups. We let $N$ be a set of
players. Any subset $S$ of $N$ can form a group called
$coalition$. A \emph{coalitional game} is a pair $G = (N, v)$,
where $v$ is called a \emph{characteristic function} $v: 2^N \to
\mathbb{R}$, mapping the set of players of the coalition to a real
number $v(S)$, the worth of $S$. This number usually represents
the output, payoff, or the performance of these players working
together as coalition.  If a coalition $S$ is formed, then it can
divide its worth, $v(S)$ in any possible way among its members.
The payoff vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^S$ is the amount of payoff
being distributed among the members of the coalition $S$. The
payoff vector satisfies two conditions:


\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_i \geq 0$ for all $i \in N$, and
    \item $\sum_{i \in N} x_i \leq v(N)$
\end{itemize}


The second criteria is called the \emph{feasibility} condition,
according to which, the payoff for each agent cannot be more than
the coalition total gain. A payoff vector is also \emph{efficient}
if the payoff obtained by a coalition is distributed amongst the
coalition members: $\sum_{i \in N} x_i = v(N)$. This definition of
the characteristic function works in \emph{transferable utility}
(TU) settings, where utility (i.e., payoff) is transferable from
one player to another, or in other words, players have common
currency and a unit of income that is worth the same for all
players \cite{myerson1991game}.


When dealing with cooperative games, two issues need to be
addressed  \cite{
DBLP:conf/ijcai/GrecoMPS11,Sandholm1999209,DBLP:conf/ijcai/RahwanMJ11}:\\ 1. Which coalitions among all possible coalitions to form? \\
2. How to reward each member when a task is completed?\\
%
The following definitions help address these two issues
\cite{shapley_value}, \cite{S1971cores}.

%\subsubsection{Shapley value}

{\bf Definition 1 (Shapley value)} Given a cooperative game $(N,
v)$, the \emph{Shapley value} of player $i$ is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:shapley}
\phi_i(N,v) = \sum_{S \subseteq N - \left\{i\right\} } \frac{|S|!
(|N|-|S|-1)!}{|N|!} (v(S \cup \left\{i\right\}) - v(S))
\end{equation}


\emph{Shapley value} is a unique and fair solution concept for
payoff distribution among the members of the coalition. It
basically rewards the members with the amount of the average
marginal contribution they add to the coalition. It checks the
contribution of a member $i$ by adding that member to all possible
subsets of coalitions $S$, where $S \subseteq N-\{i\}$. If the
member $i$ is added to the set $S$, the contribution of this set
to the coalition is $v(S \cup \left\{i\right\}) - v(S)$. The
average marginal contribution of agent $i$ is calculated by
averaging this value over all possible subsets of $N$ in the
Shapley value equation (Equation \ref{eq:shapley}).

%\subsubsection{Core}

{\bf Definition 2 (Core)} A payoff vector $x$ is in the $core$ of
a coalitional game $(N, v)$ if and only if:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:core}
\forall S \subseteq N, \sum_{i \in S} x_i \geq v(S)
\end{equation}

The core is basically a set of payoff vectors where no subset of
players $S^\prime$ could gain more than their current payoff by
deviating and making their own coalition $\sum_{i \in S^\prime}
x_i \geq v(S^\prime)$. The sum of payoffs of the players in any
sub-coalition $S$ is at least as large as the amount that these
players could earn by forming a coalition by their own. In a
sense, it is analogue to Nash equilibrium, except that core is
about deviations from groups of entities. The core is the
strongest and most popular solution concept in cooperative game
theory. However, its computation is a combinatorial problem and
becomes intractable as the number of players increases. The core
of some real-world problem games may be empty, which means having
the characteristic function of the game $(N,v)$, there might be no
possible distribution of payoff assuring stability of subgroups.


{\bf Definition 3 (Convex cooperative games)} A game $(N,v)$ with
characteristic function $v(S)$ is convex if:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:convex}
v(S) + v(T) \leq v(S \cup T) + v (S \cap T), \forall S,T \subseteq
N.
\end{equation}


According to a classic result by Shapley \cite{S1971cores}, convex
games always have a non-empty core. We will use a variation of
convexity condition in our algorithm to check whether our
coalitions are stable.

\subsubsection*{$\epsilon$-core}\label{s:epsilon}
%\emph{$\epsilon$-Core:}
%\\
When the \emph{core} set of a game is empty, it means no coalition
of players can gain anything by deviating. An outcome would be
unstable if a coalition can benefit even by a small amount from
deviating, which is a strong requirement. In fact, in some
situations, deviations can be costly, or players may have loyalty
to their coalitions, or even it can be computationally intractable
to find those small benefits. It would only make sense for a
coalition to deviate if the gain from a deviation exceeds the cost
of performing the deviation. \emph{$\epsilon$-core} relaxes the
notion of the core, and only requires that no coalition would
benefit significantly, or within a constant amount ($\epsilon$) by
deviating (see Equation \ref{eq:core}).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:core2}
\forall S \subseteq N, \sum_{i \in S} x_i \geq v(S) - \epsilon
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Coalition Structure Formation}\label{sec:coalition}

Coalition structure formation is the problem of finding the best
partition of web services into teams (i.e., communities). In these
settings, the performance of an individual service is less
important than the \emph{social welfare} of the whole system,
which is the sum of the values of all communities. Having the game
$(N,v)$, a coalition structure $(CS)$ is \emph{socially optimal}
if $CS$ belongs to set $\operatorname*{arg\,max}_{CS} v(CS)$ where
$v(CS)$ is the sum of the values of all coalitions inside $CS$.
$v(CS) = \sum_{C \in CS}v(C)$.
%The outcome of a characteristic function game in coalition structure settings, consists of two parts; first a disjoint partition of players (agents) into coalitions, called a \emph{coalition structure} (CS) and second a \emph{payoff vector} as mentioned in cooperative game solution concepts, which distributes the value of each coalition among its members.





\section{Problem Formulation and Modeling}\label{s:model}

In this section, we present  web services and community
coordinator's interactions, the task distribution process, and
revenue models in web service communities.

\subsection{Task Distribution}

As mentioned in Section \ref{webservice-communities}, communities
are robust service providers with well established market share
and reputation. By maintaining their reputation and performance,
they attract  end users which choose them as service providers to
perform their tasks. The community coordinator is characterized by a
request rate (also called input rate) $(R_C)$ from users. Each web
service comes with a given QoS ($QoS_{ws}$) from which the
throughput $Th_{ws}$ is excluded. Throughput is the average rate
of tasks a web service can perform per time unit. Its exclusion
from $QoS_{ws}$ allows us to build our analysis on the particular
value of $Th_{ws}$. Thus, web services perform tasks with an
average output quality of $QoS_{ws}$ and a throughput rate of
$Th_{ws}$.

The community coordinator uses a slightly modified \emph{weighted fair
queuing} method to distribute tasks among its members. The goal is
to allocate incoming tasks to web services with a rate matching
the throughput value of $Th_{ws}$. In the \emph{weighted fair
queuing} method, \emph{all} the input flow is multiplexed along
different paths, however in our case if the request rate $(R_C)$
of the community is more than the summation of throughput values
of the web services in the community, some of the input tasks will
be queued and served with delay. Thus, the amount of tasks
performed by the community is $\sum_{ws}{Th_{ws}}$ when
$\sum_{ws}{Th_{ws}} \leq R_{C}$. However, when the input rate
$(R_C)$ of the community is less than the summation of throughput
values of the web services in the community,
%the community has more web services having more total throughput value than community's request rate
the \emph{weighted fair queuing} algorithm assigns a weighted task
rate of $R_C \times \frac{Th_{ws}}{\sum_{ws}{Th_{ws}}}$ for each
web service ($ws$), so that the total rate of tasks being
performed is $R_C$, the community's request rate.

While distributing tasks, the community coordinator can verify the
performance, throughput and quality of service of tasks being
performed by web services. The community coordinator can recognize if those web
services are capable of doing the amount of tasks they advertised.
If for any reason there is a decline in the quality metric or
throughput, the coordinator will announce the new parameters, which
will be considered as benchmark for future performance
calculations, and penalize the suspicious web services. In this
way, players will have incentive to truthfully reveal their real
capabilities in order to profit best from the community and to
avoid being penalized. In addition, the system should be dynamic
enough to detect and react to web services quality metrics
variation as over time web service metrics may degrade or improve,
a change that the community should adjust to.
% Therefore its easy for the system to encourage players to be in some sense incentive compatible in the way that they would profit best by truthfully revealing their capabilities. Also it is important to be dynamic enough to consider web services which may have their quality metrics degraded or even improved over time for any reason and be able to adjust the community with new parameters.

\subsection{Community Revenue}

The communities and web services earn revenue by performing tasks.
The total gain is function of quality ($QoS_{ws}$) and throughput
($Th_{ws}$) of tasks being performed. As mentioned in Section
\ref{ws_parameters}, $QoS_{ws}$ is obtained by a certain
aggregation function of the parameters considered in Table
\ref{qosws}. We have adopted a linear equal weight average over
all QoS parameters listed in Table \ref{qosws} excluding the
$Throughput$ and $Cost$ parameters. A community has the option to
weigh specific QoS parameters depending on the expectations of
their clients.

The maximum potential output of a community $C$ $(PO(C))$  is an
aggregation of the number of performed tasks $T_{ws}$ times the
quality of service $QoS_{ws}$ for each web service member of the
community:

\begin{equation}
PO(C) = \sum_{ws \in C}{(T_{ws} \times QoS_{ws})}
\end{equation}

If the summation of throughput values ($Th_{ws}$) of community
members exceeds the input task rate of the community ($R_C$), the
community cannot perform at its maximum potential. This situation
denotes the case when the community has more web services than it
needs to perform the input task load. Thus, the actual output has
to be normalized to the amount of tasks being performed.

\begin{equation}\label{out_c}
Out(C) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{l l}
    PO(C) & \quad \text{if $\sum_{ws}{Th_{ws}} \leq R_{C}$}\\
    PO(C) \times \frac{R_{C}}{\sum_{ws}{Th_{ws}}} & \quad \text{if $\sum_{ws}{Th_{ws}} > R_{C}$}
  \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}

The revenue function of the web service community is a linear
function of $Out(C)$ with a positive constant multiplier. The
worth of a community is set to the output the community can
generate, i.e., $v(C) = Out(C)$.

\subsection{Illustrative Examples}

In this section, we analyze three numerical examples and discuss
the motivation of web services and community interactions, the
strategies they can adopt, and the revenue they can earn by
adopting these different strategies.

In the first example,  we present the case of a community with
$R_C =10 $, and three web services, each having different
$QoS_{ws}$ and $Th_{ws}$ values as listed in Table
\ref{example_1}. As mentioned earlier, the worth of the community
$C$ $v(C)$ is set to $Out(C)$ (Equation \ref{out_c}) which is the
amount of output being generated by the community. The first table
lists the web services with their aggregated $QoS_{ws}$
parameters, their task input rate while working alone, and also
their throughput value $Th_{ws}$. The second table shows all the
possible communities and their respective worth. The obtained
values show that communities having more web services have better
gain and output. However each community needs to distribute the
gain between web services. Sometimes it is impossible to share the
gain between all web services in a way that no subset of them
would individually gain more if they form their own group. In this
example, the value community of ${ws_1}$ and ${ws_2}$ is 7.2, and
with ${ws_3}$ joining the community, the worth increases to 8.0.
However there is no way to distribute the value among web services
to have ${ws_1}$ and ${ws_2}$  earning 7.2, and ${ws_3}$ earning
at least 2.4, the gain they could earn before joining the
community. This fact makes the group unstable. In the second
example, shown in Table \ref{example_2}, we even have situations
where a web service (${ws_3}$) joining a community
($\left\{ws_1,ws_2\right\}$) decreases the value of the community.
The reason is because the community is already full and all tasks
are almost being distributed and new community with bad quality
can degrade the average quality of tasks being done by the
community. In both examples, the request of joining of web service
${ws_3}$ should be rejected by the community.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE 3 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In Example 3, we consider the case of having different communities
with different market shares represented by ${R_C}$ values. Web
services also have a small share of market independently,
providing them with a small task pull. In these kind of scenarios,
the solution considers individual maximization of payoff and also
the total worth of all communities which represents the
\emph{social welfare}. In this example, the most efficient
partition of web services is earned by having two coalitions of
$\left\{C_{1}, ws_2\right\}$ and $\left\{C_{2},
ws_1, ws_3\right\}$, which yields a total value of $32 + 16 = 48$.
In these types of scenarios, the goal is to reach stability,
adopting a distributed approach where all players have the power
to decide about joining a coalition or not. The communities
usually start the game having some established members. They may
exchange web services and new web services would join them having
at least one player gaining utility without hurting any other
participant. In this example, if we initially having two
coalitions of $\left\{C_{1}, ws_2\right\}$ and
$\left\{C_{2}, ws_1\right\}$ and a ${ws_3}$ as new web
service, ${ws_3}$ joining ${C_{1}}$ would hurt at least
itself or $ws_2$; however, ${ws_3}$ joining ${C_{2}}$ would
not hurt any participant and ${ws_3}$ would earn more within the
community and the community will have enough web services
performing the incoming tasks from users.

The first two examples illustrate the fact that a community cannot
simply increase its revenue by adding more web services. The web
services and even community owners are autonomous agents and would
deviate and be displeased about the community if new members cause
a drop in their profit. The job of the community coordinator is to
attract as many quality web services it can and keep them
satisfied; hence the group stability is guaranteed. The third
example highlights another type of problem we would like to
address, which is how to form best possible groups of communities,
and allocate web services among communities in a way which would
maximize the payoff of members already residing in the
communities. In the next section, we provide algorithms based on
collaborative game theory to tackle these problems and find
applicable and efficient strategies for communities and web
services to maximize their profit.


\section{Web Service Cooperative Games}\label{s:game_solution}

In this section, we present different web service community models
and focus on the problem of how both web services and community
coordinators as rational entities would adopt strategies to maximize
their payoff.

\subsection {Scenario 1: Web Services and One Community}

In this scenario, we assume the existence of a typical community
managed by its coordinator, and web services need to join it to be
able to get requests from the community. The community coordinator
is characterized by a request rate $(R_{C})$ from users. Each web
service comes with a given QoS ($QoS_{ws}$). Moreover, we recall
that the worth of a community $v(C)$ is set to $Out(C)$ based on
Equation \ref{out_c}.

As mentioned in the previous section, the worth of a community is
a function of the throughput and provided QoS of its web service
members. If the throughput rate is more than the community's input
request rate, it means the web services inside the community are
capable of serving more requests than the demand. Considering this
factor, the valuation function is designed to balance the output
performance so that it matches the exact throughput rate and QoS
the web service can provide within the particular community.
%** In the case where the limited tasks are distributed among web services uniformly, the value of coalition would be the proportion of the average QoS times their throughput to rate of available requests. **

In this first scenario, we only consider one \emph{grand
coalition} and analyze the system from the point of view of one
community and a collection of web services. In cooperative game
theory, grand coalition is a coalition that contains a maximum
number of players as long as they can maintain a stable (in terms
of membership) and beneficial (in terms of utility) group for all
the players. The community coordinator decides which members can
join
%or should leave%
the community and distributes the requests and income among its
community members (see Figure \ref{fig_sim1}). The generalization
of this case will be discussed in the next section (Scenario 2).

\begin{figure*}%[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3in]{s1.eps}`
\caption{Web services and a grand community} \label{fig_sim1}
\end{figure*}

The membership decision is made based on throughput and \emph{QoS}
of the considered web service. The goal is to have quality web
services in the community so it stays stable and no other web
services would have incentives to deviate and leave the community
$C$. Therefore, a basic method would be to check the core of the
coalition $C$ considering all the current community members (all
web services already residing within the community) and the new
web service. This algorithm uses the Shapley value distribution
method as described in Equation \ref{eq:shapley} to distribute the
gain of $v(C)$ among all the members and then checks if the
Shapley value payoff vector for this community having the
characteristic function $v(C)$ is in the \emph{core}. In the
Shapley value payoff vector, the payoff for each web service $i$
(we will use $i$ instead of $ws_i$ for simplification) is
calculated based on its marginal contribution $v(C \cup {i}) -
v(C)$ over all the possible different permutations in which the
coalition can be formed, which makes the payoff distribution fair.
Because of going through all the possible permutations of subsets
of $C$, the computation of the Shapley value becomes
combinatorial, which makes it impractical to use as the size of
our coalitions grows. However, it is proven that in convex games,
the Shapley value lies in the core
\cite{DBLP:conf/ijcai/GrecoMPS11, myerson1991game}. Thus, if the
\emph{Core} is non-empty, the payoff vector is a member of the
\emph{Core}. The following proposition is important to make our
algorithm tractable.
% so in our algorithm we check the core membership of this payoff vector.

We first prove the ``only if'' direction:

Consequently, the game is convex.

have: \setlength{\abovedisplayshortskip}{2pt}

\begin{gather*}
v(S \cup \left\{i\right\}) - v((S \cup \left\{i\right\}) \cap T)

\\
\rightarrow v(S \cup \left\{i\right\}) - v(S) \leq v(T \cup
\left\{i\right\}) - v(T)
\end{gather*}

\end{proof}


Thus, in order to keep the characteristic function $v$ convex, new
web services should have more marginal contribution as the
coalition size grows.

Our algorithm works as follows. Given an established community
with a coordinator and some member web services, a web service would
send a \emph{join request} to join  the community. Ideally, the
\emph{core} or \emph{$\epsilon$-core} stability of the group
having this new member should be analyzed. As the normal core
membership algorithm is computationally intractable, we exploit
Proposition \ref{proposition1} and Equation \ref{eq:convex_snow}
to check the convexity condition for our game considering the characteristic function
when the new member is added. In this equation (i.e., Equation
\ref{eq:convex_snow}), let $C$ be our community members before the
new web service joins the community. Let  ${i}$ be the new web
service, and then verify the equation for $S$, setting $ S = T /
W1 $ where $W1$ is the set of all possible subsets of the set $N$
having the size $1$. We can relax the equation a bit by adding a
constant $\epsilon$ to the left side of the equation. We call this
method \emph{Depth-1 Convex-Checker} algorithm. If the equation is
satisfied for all $W1$, we let the new web service join our
community, since the web service will contribute positively enough
to make our new community stable. Since only subsets of size $1$
are checked, the following Proposition holds.

\begin{theorem}\label{complexity1}
\emph{The run time complexity of Depth-1 Convex-Checker algorithm
is $O(|C|)$.}
\end{theorem}

By this result, we obtain a significant reduction from
$O(2^{|C|})$, which is the complexity of checking all possible
subsets of $C$. In our second method, we use the same algorithm,
but this time we set $W2$ to be the set of all possible subsets of
size two of the community $C$. We call this method \emph{Depth-2
Convex-Checker} and its run time complexity is still linear:

\begin{theorem}\label{complexity2}
\emph{The run time complexity of Depth-2 Convex-Checker algorithm
is $O(|C|^2)$.}
\end{theorem}

In fact, it is possible to develop an algorithm that continues the
verification of this condition against subsets of size $3$, $4$,
etc., until the algorithm gets interrupted. This interruption can
be either caused by time/memory constraints when the number of
subsets is big enough (timeout) or forced manually by the system
designer if for example the already obtained results are
satisfactory. In fact, if the algorithm gets interrupted while
verifying $depth(n)$, it will have $depth(n-1)$ already verified.
For instance, if the algorithm gets interrupted at depth $10$
(manually or because of system resources), all the subsets of
depth $9$ are already successfully checked.

\subsection {Scenario 2: Web Services and Many Communities}

In this scenario, we consider multiple communities managed by
multiple coordinators, each of communities having
independent request pools (see Figure \ref{fig_sim2}).
%Identical to the first scenario, master web services form coalitions with web services.
We use coalition structure formation methods to
partition web services into non-empty disjoint coalition
structures. As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:coalition}, the key
fundamental problems we aim to solve is what communities to form
out of the existing web services, and how to divide the payoffs
among the collaborators.

\begin{figure*}%[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3in]{s2.eps}
\caption{Web services and many communities} \label{fig_sim2}
\end{figure*}

In coalition-formation games, formation of the coalitions is the
most important aspect. The solutions focus on maximizing the
social welfare \cite{
DBLP:conf/ijcai/GrecoMPS11,Sandholm1999209,DBLP:conf/ijcai/RahwanMJ11}.
For any coalition structure $\pi$, let $v_{cs}(\pi)$ denote the
total worth $\sum_{C \in \pi}{v(C)}$, which represents the
\emph{social welfare}. The solution concepts deal with finding the
maximum value for the social welfare over all the coalition
structure $\pi$. There are $centralized$ algorithms for this end,
but these approaches are generally NP-complete. The reason is that
the number of all possible partitions of the set $C$ grows
exponentially with the number of players, and the centralized
algorithms need to iterate through all these partitions.
%These algorithms \cite{DBLP:conf/ijcai/GrecoMPS11, DBLP:conf/ijcai/RahwanMJ11, RePEc:wpa:wuwpga:0110001} are centralized algorithms, where all the complexity. However these algorithms are more intractable than Core stable solutions and practical with some constraints in practice\cite{RePEc:wpa:wuwpga:0110001}.
In our model, we propose using a distributed algorithm where each
community coordinator and web service can be a decision maker and
decide for its own benefit. The aim is to find less complex and
distributed algorithms for forming web services coalitions
\cite{DBLP:journals/igtr/AptW09,Dieckmann02dynamiccoalition,ray2007game}.
The distributed merge-and-split algorithm in
\cite{DBLP:journals/igtr/AptW09} suits our application very well.
It keeps splitting and merging coalitions to partitions which are
preferred by all the players inside those coalitions.

This merge-and-split algorithm is designed to be adaptable to
different applications. One major ingredient to use such an
algorithm is a preference relation or well-defined orders proper
for comparing collections of different coalition partitions of the
same set of players. Having two partition sets of players, namely
$P = {P_1,...,P_k}$ and $Q = {Q_1,...Q_l}$, one example would be
to use the social welfare comparison $\sum^k_{i=1}v(P_i) >
\sum^l_{j=1}v(Q_j)$. For our scenario, we use \emph{Pareto order}
comparison, which is an individual-value order appropriate for our
self-interest web services. In the Pareto order, an allocation or
partition $P$ is preferred over another $Q$ if at least one player
improves its payoff in the new allocation and all the other
players still maintain their payoff ($p_i \geq q_i$ with at least
one element $p_i > q_i$).

The valuation function $v(C)$ for this scenario is the same as for
Scenario 1 (i.e., \emph{``Web Services and One Community''}).
%However, in order to prevent master web services joining the same community, we set $v(C) = 0$ when $C$ has either none, or more than one master web service as member.

In this scenario, as new web services are discovered and get ready
to join communities, our algorithm keeps merging and splitting
partitions based on the preference function. The decision to merge
or split is based on the fact that all players must benefit. The
new web services will merge with communities if $all$ the players
are able to improve their individual payoff, and some web services
may split from old communities, if splitting does not decrease the
payoff of \emph{any} web service of the community. According to
\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-cs-0605132}, this sequence of merging
and splitting will converge to a final partition, where web
services cannot improve their payoff. More details of this
algorithm and analysis of generic solutions on coalition formation
games are described in \cite{DBLP:journals/igtr/AptW09}.

\subsection{Taxation, Subsiding and Community Stability}\label{s:tax}

We discussed $core$ as one of the prominent solution concepts in
cooperative games. Working together, completing tasks and
generating revenue, agents need to distribute the gain in a way no
agents would gain more by forming their own group. However, in
most cases, the core of a game is empty, so we introduced the
\emph{$\epsilon$-core} concept, where agents would only earn a
minimal amount of $\epsilon$ by deviating from the coalition.
Stability is an attractive property for communities. In addition,
communities would benefit by having slightly more web services
than the exact number of web services needed to satisfy the task
rate cap. This is because there is always a possibility that the
web services may leave the community or they may under perform and
degrade the quality values they were initially performing with.

The solution we propose for communities to ensure stability is
applying a tax $\epsilon$, which is an amount of cost for those
web services that decide to change communities (let us say from
$C$ to $C'$), which would make deviation a costly act. However,
this would require all the community coordinators to agree on a
same amount of taxation, being governed by some external entities;
otherwise, web services would join communities charging the lowest
amount of tax. Before deciding to change the community, each web
service $i$ has to be sure that the gain $g_i(C \rightarrow C')$
calculated in Equation \ref{eq:gainsh} based on the Shapley values
of $i$ in the previous and new communities and the tax $\epsilon$
is positive, which means, what the web service would gain in $C'$
is greater than what it gains in $C$ and the tax it would pay if
moving all together:


\begin{equation}\label{eq:gainsh}
g_i(C \rightarrow C') = \phi_i(C',v) - \phi_i(C,v) - \epsilon
\end{equation}


Another viable solution we introduce to our scenario is to
stabilize the game using external subsidies. The reason a game is
not stable is that the community is not making enough revenue to
allocate enough gain to the players. A community coordinator can
subside its community with a constant coefficient value of
$\lambda$.

%Rewarding a community with high number of quality participants
%with $\lambda v(C)$, where $\lambda \leq 1$.
%
Obviously, with a big value for $\lambda$, it is always possible
to stabilize the community. However, this can be a costly act for
the community coordinators, so they are interested in the minimum
subside value of $\lambda$ making the community stable. This can
be achieved by solving the following linear program:
%
  \begin{alignat*}{3}
    \min~   & \lambda  \\
    \text{s.t. } & \lambda v(C) > v(C') & ~& \text{ for all } C' \subset C
  \end{alignat*}


%When a new web service $i$, wants to join the community, the
%valuation function of the community members and the new web
%service is subsided by the community coordinator in order to
%incentivize formation of this community and is set to:
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:taxv}
%v'(C \cup \{i\}) = \lambda \times v(C \cup \{i\})
%\end{equation}
%In equation \ref{eq:taxv} the value of $v'$ is
%replaced with the valuation function for the new forming coalition
%$C \cup \{i\}$.
Subsiding or taxing in order to reduce the
bargaining power of sub coalitions are called $taxation$
\cite{eps346856} methods. We evaluate the effectiveness of these
two methods experimentally through extensive implementations in
the next section.


%Thus, another way to garantee \emph{$\epsilon$-core} stability can be achieved by some surplus payments from community coordinators. These concepts of applying cost in coallition values in order to reduce their bargaining power are called $taxtation$ methods\cite{eps346856}.

%The \emph{$\epsilon$-core} concept, in its definition, considers the willing to join or deviate from agent's point of view. It claims agents for any reason will be not willing to deviate to gain less than $\epsilon$ amount of profit. Communities can agree on However, in our case, the community master is willing to keep web services in communities too. There are several reasons for this, one reason is there is always possibility that agents may leave the community or they may under perform from the quality values they were initially performing with. To this end, our communities will reward and valuate web services in the community



\section{Experimental Results and Analysis}\label{s:resutls}

In this section, we discuss the experiments we performed for our
scenarios to validate the applicability and performance of our
proposed methods in realistic environments. We used flight booking
services and airlines coalitions as concrete application domain
(see Section \ref{s:introduction} for details about the example).
An XML SOAP based messaging system was implemented. The request
contains the flight dates, the origin and destination, type of
tickets, and number of guests. The response contains different
flights with different companies, prices, timing, etc. We have
gathered around 200,000 flights and stored them in our MongoDB
database. We created a pool of web services and populated most of
their \emph{QoS} parameters from a real world web service dataset
\cite{DBLP:conf/smc/Al-MasriM09a}\footnote[1]{The implemented
environment includes the QWS dataset by Eyhab Al-Masri and Qusay
H. Mahmoud freely available at:
http://www.uoguelph.ca/\textasciitilde{}qmahmoud/qws/.}. To test
our methods, we formed around 10,000 random coalitions consisting
of 3 to 160 web services. This number is large enough since in the
concrete examples of coalitions in the airlines domain, the
largest coalition, Star
Alliance\footnote{\url{www.staralliance.com}}, has 28 airline
members. In average, the communities were populated by 60 web
services. Thus, in total, the number of used web services is
600,000. This makes our system scalable enough. We implemented the
scenarios using Java and executed the experiments on an Intel Xeon
X3450 machine with 6GBs of memory. For other parameters missing
from the dataset, we used normal random distribution with
parameters estimated using the method of maximum likelihood.

One of the key criteria reflecting the performance of web service
coalitions is the user satisfaction. User satisfaction can be
measured in terms of quality and quantity of requests (or tasks)
successfully answered by the communities. We initiate the
communities with few web services, then let rejecting and
accepting random web services go for a short number of iterations.
After that, we start the request distribution for the communities
and let them allocate requests among member web services.
Thereafter, we measure the average output performance of tasks in
communities following different methods.

\caption{Part (a): Cumulative number of requests successfully
done. Part (b): Average QoS of requests performed.}
\label{performanceall}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{performanceall} depicts the results of our methods:
\emph{Depth-1 Convex-Checker} and \emph{Depth-2 Convex-Checker},
and compares them with \emph{3-Way Satisfaction} (from
\cite{DBLP:conf/IEEEscc/LimTMB12}), and \emph{2 Player
Non-Cooperative} (from \cite{DBLP:conf/IEEEscc/KhosravifarABT11})
methods in \emph{one grand community with many web services}
scenario. The figure also depicts the results of the theoretical
\emph{optimal $\epsilon$-core} as benchmark.


For the \emph{optimal core} method, we have used the well known
\emph{$\epsilon$-core} method as the taxation method to relax the
core condition to help communities attract web services. We have
assigned $\epsilon$ to 15\% of total community worth, which means
$\epsilon = 0.15 \times v(C)$. This allows subsets of the
coalition to gain maximum 15\% of $v(C)$. In the \emph{optimal
$\epsilon$-core} method, we capped the coalition size to 25 web
services, since the method is computationally intractable as the
number of web services increases. In fact, given the machine
configuration we used in our experiments, the maximum number we
could run for this method is 25, which is very realistic if we
consider the real airlines coalitions (the three well known
coalitions have respectively 28, 19, and 13 members). In the other
methods, there were no cap on size of the community and we had
communities of size 160 web services at some points, as discussed
above. In the experiments, our \emph{Depth-1 Convex-Checker} and
\emph{Depth-2 Convex-Checker} methods generate results instantly
(0.01ms in Java millisecond time unit granularity) in our machines
since their runtime with respect to the size of input (number of
web services) is $O(n)$ and $O(n^2)$ respectively. This shows that
the algorithms are efficient and the system is easily scalable. In
this scenario, our community receives 130 tasks from users on
average per iteration. These tasks are about flight booking and
are expected to be performed by the community. They are randomly
generated using a poisson distribution (having 130 as parameter).
Depending on community task queue and the assigned web services'
quality metrics the task will be performed with some qualities.
The community, after the task distribution process on each
iteration, will reevaluate QoS metrics of its members and can
check for new membership requests. Web services may join or leave
the community between iterations. The results show that our
\emph{depth-2 convex checker} method is performing better compared
to the other methods and its performance is close to the optimal
\emph{$\epsilon$-core} method. Our \emph{depth-1 convex checker}
and the \emph{3-Way Satisfaction} method, are also performing
well.

\caption{Analysis of \emph{$\epsilon$-core} set non-emptiness for
different values of $\epsilon$} \label{f_leastcore}
\end{figure*}

As mentioned in Section \ref{s:preliminaries}, the concept of
\emph{core}, assumes no coalition of players can gain anything by
deviating, which is a fairly strong requirement, and that is why
the notion of \emph{$\epsilon$-core} was introduced. Least-Core
$e(G)$ of a game $G$ is the minimum amount of $\epsilon$ so that
the core is not empty. We evaluated the non-emptiness of
\emph{$\epsilon$-core} set using our valuation function and a set
of web services from our coalitions.  The restriction on the
number of web services per coalition for this particular method is
justified because it is
%We picked random number of web services from the
%dataset and formed around 10,000 random coalitions consisting of 3
%to 28 web services. We choose 28 as the maximum number of members
%in our coalitions since in the concrete examples of coalitions in
%the airline domain we are implementing, the largest coalition,
%Star Alliance\footnote{\url{www.staralliance.com}}, has 28 airline
%members. This makes the total number of web services achieves
%280,000, which is scalable enough. Moreover, it is computationally
very complex for larger coalitions to verify whether
\emph{$\epsilon$-core} set is empty or not. Also instead of
considering $\epsilon$ amount of constant deviation in
\emph{$\epsilon$-core} definition (Equation \ref{eq:core2}), we
similarly defined \emph{relative $\epsilon$-core} concept where no
coalition would benefit more than \emph{$\epsilon \times v(C)$} by
deviating. We vary $\epsilon$ so that it takes different values
from $0$ to $1$ and observe the impact in terms of verifying the
\emph{relative $\epsilon$-core} set non-emptiness. The results in
Figure \ref{f_leastcore} illustrate that almost 10\% of our random
web service coalitions have non-empty \emph{core} solution and
\emph{$\epsilon$-core} solution is \emph{always} non-empty when we
let agents gain only 30\% more of $v(C)$ by deviating.

One of the properties of coalition structure formation algorithms
in our second scenario is that they partition web services with
low throughput rate so that they usually join coalitions with less
request rate. Since the characteristic function $v(C)$ and the
fair Shapley payoff vector is proportional to web services'
contribution, the web services with small contribution will get
paid much less in communities having web services with high
throughput. On the other hand, according to the valuation function
$v(C)$, web services with high throughput will not contribute well
to communities with low amount of user requests (low market
share). The strong web services are likely to deviate from weak
coalitions, joining a stronger one, which makes the initial
coalition unstable.

\caption{Analysis of community subsiding coefficient $\lambda$ on
average community size (a), cost (b), number of tasks performed
(c), and average quality of service of tasks performed (d).}
\label{f_taxtation}
\end{figure*}

As mentioned in Section \ref{s:tax}, a solution to help the
community stabilize is to subside the community by a relative
coefficient ($\lambda$) so the value of $\lambda v(C)$ is divided
among the community members. We have analyzed the effect of
subsiding and the cost it incurs to our web service communities.
Figure \ref{f_taxtation} shows the results. In this experiment, we
have set a community with input task rate $R_C$ of 100 and having
web services throughput rate $Th_{ws}$ values from a normal
distribution with average 10 tasks per iteration and standard
deviation 2. Part (a) shows the community size increases in a
linear fashion as ($\lambda$) increases. However, the cost (Part
(b)) is having a slight exponential growth rate since, not only
($\lambda$) increases, but also the size of the community is
increasing slowly. Therefore, subsiding can be costly for larger
number of $\lambda$ values. Part (c) depicts the number of tasks
done by the community per iteration. It is obvious that with
$\lambda$ value of 1.3, which is 30\% of the community valuation,
the number of tasks done almost reaches the input task rate cap of
100 tasks per iteration. The average quality of tasks also has a
slight increase since the community will be able to afford better
and more web services to join the community (Part (d)). These
results show the effectiveness of our subsiding method and its
impact on the QoS. In fact, using more than 30\% of the community
valuation as subsidy is not very effective and is costly to
perform.

\begin{figure*}%[!t]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=6.8in]{tax_dyn.eps}}
\caption{Analysis of community subsiding coefficient $\lambda$
having web service different stability levels of $\tau$ on average
community size, number of tasks performed, average quality of
service, and average cost/income of communities.}
\label{fig_dynamic_taxtation}
\end{figure*}


In the previous experiment, we considered the scenario where all
web services are stable, will not leave the group, and will
fulfill their promised QoS for a good period of time. However, in
real world scenarios of web services, this is not always the case.
This is the reason why the community coordinator would be interested in paying
web services in order to keep the group reliable from the end
user's point of view. In our next scenario, we have introduced the
new instability variable $\tau$ ranging from 0 to 1, 0 meaning web
services having no instability issues and will perform as they
claimed until the end of the experiment, and 1 meaning very
unstable web services, which will stop functioning on the first
iteration of the community distributing tasks. Figure
\ref{fig_dynamic_taxtation} illustrates the results of our
experiment having web services with average instability values of
0 to 0.5 and having relative subside value $\lambda$ of 1, 1.3,
1.6, and 2. The \emph{Cost/Income} charts on the right column show
that having subside value of 1.3 incurs the least cost and
increases the community income significantly. Subsiding values of
1.6 and 2 yield high cost to the community and only slightly
increase the community revenue. Moreover, the role of subsiding is
much more obvious when we have unstable web services. In scenarios
where web services are 100\% stable, the subsiding cost will
hardly be compensated by the community revenue.

\caption{Part (a): Cumulative number of tasks successfully done.
Part (b): Average QoS of tasks performed.} \label{performancemany}
\end{figure*}


In Figure \ref{performancemany}, we consider \emph{Web Services
and many Communities} scenario and we compare our dynamic
coalition formation solution with a method which ignores QoS
parameters and forms communities by allowing web services to join
only if they have enough requests for themselves. In other words,
web services can join a community when the request rate is less
than the throughput of all the member web services. We name this
method \emph{Random Formation} and use it as a benchmark for our
QoS-aware community formation process. In this scenario, each user
individually generates randomly between 0 to 10 number of tasks
per iteration, then the users target a community and direct their
requests to the chosen community. As the results illustrate, our
method forms better communities of web services improving
performance and satisfaction for both web services and
communities.

service availability} \label{fig_avail_method}
\end{figure*}

Finally, in our last experiment, we compare our model with the
solution proposed in \cite{10.1109/TSC.2012.12}, which we call
\emph{High Availability Coalition} model. In this method, the
community valuation function focuses on the community availability
as main consideration. The community formation model used in this
method is very different from ours, but we have been very careful
to make the experiment environment as fair and similar to ours as
possible. We limited our maximum community size to 5 in order to
have communities with almost the same size as in
\cite{10.1109/TSC.2012.12}. In the High Availability Coalition
model, the authors have used web services as backups rather than
active collaborative players, and those web services only get a
task when the first web service in an ordered chain fails to
perform that task. %However, with recent advancement in cloud and
%hardware infrastructures, availability is less of an issue for web
%services, and web services are highly available.
Part(a) of Figure \ref{fig_avail_method} shows that with our
method, the number of tasks successfully done is higher with a
rate of three times more than the High Availability Coalition
model thanks to the cooperative behavior of web services and the
task distribution process of our algorithm. This result shows that
using web services as backups, and not as real collaborative
players results in a considerable waste of web services capability
since services have very low chance of getting jobs and its the
primary web service (the first in the coordination chain) which
does most of the work. As shown in Part (b), the average quality
of service of tasks performed using our solution is also higher
since our method considers all quality of service metrics
mentioned in Table \ref{qosws}. Part(c) shows the availability of
communities from the end user's point of view. The High
Availability Coalition model has almost 100\% uptime since web
services are used as backups, so the chance of job failing is
getting reduced significantly as community members increase. In
our method, we have more chance of failure for each web service.
However, with some subsidies and by hiring a few more web
services, the chance of failure of web services in our communities
can be lowered.

\section{Conclusion}\label{s:conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed a cooperative game theory-based model
for the aggregation of web services within communities. The goal
of our services is to maximize efficiency by collaborating and
forming stable coalitions. Our method considers stability and
fairness for all web services within a community and offers an
applicable mechanism for membership requests and selection of web
services. The ultimate goal is to increase revenue by improving
user satisfaction, which comes from the ability to perform more
tasks with high quality. Simulation results show that our,
polynomial in complexity, approximation algorithms provide web
services and community owners with applicable and near-optimal
decision making mechanisms.

As future work, we would like to perform more analytical and
theoretical analysis on the convexity condition and also minimal
$\epsilon$ values in \emph{$\epsilon$-core} solution concepts
based on the characteristic function in web service applications.
From web service perspective, the work can be extended to consider
web service compositions where a group of web services having
different set of skills cooperate to perform composite tasks. Also
bargaining theory from cooperating game theory concepts can be
used to help web services resolve the instability and unfairness
issues by side payments.
