%         \item Cooperative games are a branch of game theory that models cooperation or collaboration between agents within coalitions.
%    \end{itemize}
    \begin{definition} [Coalition]~\\
       We have a population $N$ of $n$ agents, A coalition $C$ is a set of agents: $C \in 2^N$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $N$ is the set of all agents (or players)
            \item $v:2^N \rightarrow R$ is the \emph{valuation function}. For $C \subseteq N$, $v(C)$ is the value obtained by the coalition $C$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{definition}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Problem:} Given a game $(N,v)$, and assuming all agents in $N$ want to cooperate, how to distribute the gain among the agents?
        \item \textbf{Solution:} a payoff distribution $x \in R^n$ that provides a value to individual agents.

%        \begin{itemize}
%            \item What are the interesting properties that $x$ should satisfy?
%            \item How to determine the payoff vector $x$?

%        \begin{itemize}
%            \item Utility is worth the same for all agents.
%            \item Utility can be {\color{red} compared} or {\color{red} transferred} between agents.
%            \item Irrespective of the division of the coalitional payoff.
%            \begin{itemize}
%                \item In that case members of the coalition enjoy the same total utility.
%            \end{itemize}
%        \end{itemize}
%
%
%        \begin{definition} [Valuation or Characteristic Function]\label{dfn:valuationfunction}
%            A \emph{valuation function v} associates a real number $v(C)$ to any subset $C \subseteq N$, i.e., $v:2^N \rightarrow R$ \\
%            A {\color{blue}\emph{TU game}} is a pair $(N,v)$ where $N$ is a set of agents and where $v$ is a valuation function.

%
%
%
%        \item \textbf{Games with Non Transferable Utility (NTU games)} \\
%            Agents have different preferences over coalitions and rewards. Non-monetary rewards, i.e. item allocation type of problems where items have %different values for different players.

\begin{frame}{Solution Concepts: Shapley Value}
    \begin{definition} [Marginal Contribution]\label{dfn:marginalcontribution}
        The {\color{blue}marginal contribution} of agent $i$ for a coalition $C \subseteq N \backslash \{i\}$ is $mc_i(C) = v(C \cup \{i\}) - v(C)$
    \end{definition}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item By considering average marginal contribution over all possible subsets of coalitions, we can achieve a fair distribution.\\
        \item Let $\prod(N)$ denote the set of all permutations of the sequence $(1,...n)$. Therefore: $\phi_i(N,v) = \frac{\sum_{\sigma \in \phi_i(N)}}{mc(\sigma)}$
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{definition} [Shapley Value]\label{dfn:shapleyvalue}
        Given a coalitional game $(N,v)$, the Shapley value of player $i$ is given by: \\
        $\phi_i(N,v) = \sum_{S \subseteq N \backslash \left\{i\right\} } \frac{|S|! (|N|-|S|-1)!}{|N|!} (v(S \cup \left\{i\right\}) - v(S))$
    \end{definition}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Some Properties}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The core set can be empty or have many solutions.
        \item Shapley value always exists and is unique.
        \item When the valuation function is {\color{blue}superadditive}, the Shapley value is {\color{blue}individually rational}, i.e., it is an imputation.
        \item When the valuation function is {\color{blue}convex}, the Shapley value is also group rational, hence, it is in the {\color{blue}core}.
        \item A convex game has a non-empty core.
        \item Core and Shapley value are combinatorial problems.

\begin{frame}{Problem Formulation and Modeling}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Communities of web services are robust service providers with well established market share and reputation.
        \item The community is characterized by a request rate $R_C$.
        \item Web services can perform tasks with some throughput rate ($Th_{ws}$).
        \item Web services come with different values of $QoS_{ws}$ for different metrics.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Task Distribution}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Our model uses a slightly modified \emph{weighted fair queuing} method for task distribution rather than Contract-Net.
        \item All the input flow is multiplexed among different web services with weights proportional to their throughput value ($Th_{ws}$).
        \item Queues will happen if $R_C$ is more than the summation of web services throughput.
        \item Weighted task rate: $R_C \times \frac{Th_{ws}}{\sum_{ws}{Th_{ws}}}$ or $Th_{ws}$
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}{Contributions}
    \begin{itemize}     	
        	\item We proposed an optimal method for formation and membership management of communities of web services ensuring satisfaction of all the members involved and stability of group.
        	\item We proposed a valuation function and a polynomial approximation algorithm for the NP-Hard problem of coalition stability check, making decision making practical in real-time settings for our web service communities.
        	\item We proposed a novel approach for training communities using a small set of training data, to be able to efficiently make decisions in distributed and real-world environments where information is not complete.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Future Work}
    \begin{itemize}     	
    	\item To implement communities using bargaining theory where agents can have side payments to insure group stability
    	\item To do more analytical and theoretical analysis on the convexity condition and also minimal $\epsilon$ values in \emph{$\epsilon$-core} solution concepts and constant factor  of our $Depth-k$ approximation algorithm.
    	\item To use the SVM machine learning algorithm as learning algorithm for training our data set to better distinguish decisions based on long-term utility.

%\begin{frame}{Induced Subgraph Games}
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item An induced subgraph game is a coalitional game defined by an undirected weighted graph $G = (V,W)$ where $V$ is the set of vertices and $W : V \rightarrow V$ is the set of edges weights. For $(i,j) \in V^2$, $w_{ij}$ is the weight of the edge between $i$ and $j$.
%        \item $N = V$
%        \item for all $C \subseteq N, v(C) = \sum_{(i,j) \in C} w_{ij}$
%        \item {\color{blue}Space Complexity:} Using an adjacency matrix, we need to provide $n^2$ entries.
%        \item {\color{blue}Convexity:} If all the weights are nonnegative then the game is convex.
%        \item {\color{blue}Shapley Value:} $\phi_i(N,v) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{(i,j) \in N^2 | i \neq j}w_{ij}$
%        \item This is {\color{blue}not complete}. Many coalition games cannot be represented by a induced subgraph game.
