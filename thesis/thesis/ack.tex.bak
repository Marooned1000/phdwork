First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Jamal Bentahar for accepting to supervise my thesis. %after I have worked for a period of time in a different research area.
This dissertation would not have been possible without his help. %It was his valuable discussions, feedback, and nice explanations that helped me accomplish this thesis.
I am really grateful to him for the trust he put on me, for the support he offered me, and for guiding me in finding my place in the academic world.

I would also like to thank Dr. E. Shakshuki, Dr. O. Ormandjieva, Dr. R. Dssuli, and Dr. A. Ben Hamza for accepting to serve in the examination committee.
