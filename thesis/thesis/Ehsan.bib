The operations and messages are described abstractly, and then bound to a concrete network protocol and message format to define an endpoint. Related concrete endpoints are combined into abstract endpoints (services). WSDL is extensible to allow description of endpoints and their messages regardless of what message formats or network protocols are used to communicate, however, the only bindings described in this document describe how to use WSDL in conjunction with SOAP 1.1, HTTP GET/POST, and MIME}},

abstract = "Using service-oriented decision support systems (DSS in cloud) is one of the major trends for many organizations in hopes of becoming more agile. In this paper, after defining a list of requirements for service-oriented DSS, we propose a conceptual framework for \{DSS\} in cloud, and discus about research directions. A unique contribution of this paper is its perspective on how to servitize the product oriented \{DSS\} environment, and demonstrate the opportunities and challenges of engineering service oriented \{DSS\} in cloud. When we define data, information and analytics as services, we see that traditional measurement mechanisms, which are mainly time and cost driven, do not work well. Organizations need to consider value of service level and quality in addition to the cost and duration of delivered services. \{DSS\} in \{CLOUD\} enables scale, scope and speed economies. This article contributes new knowledge in service science by tying the information technology strategy perspectives to the database and design science perspectives for a broader audience. "
